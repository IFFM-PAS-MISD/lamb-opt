abstract = {Composite materials are widely used in the industry, and the interest of this material is growing rapidly, due to its light weight, strength and various other desired mechanical properties. However, composite materials are prone to production defects and other defects originated during exploitation, which may jeopardize the safety of such a structure. Thus, non-destructive evaluation methods that are material-independent and suitable for a wide range of defects identification are needed. In this paper, a technique for damage characterization in composite plates is proposed. In the presented non-destructive testing method, guided waves are excited by a piezoelectric transducer, attached to tested specimens, and measured by a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer in a dense grid of points. By means of signal processing, irregularities in wavefield images caused by any material defects are extracted and used for damage characterization. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated on four different composite panels: Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, glass fiber-reinforced polymer, composite reinforced by randomly-oriented short glass fibers and aluminum-honeycomb core sandwich composite. Obtained results confirm its versatility and efficacy in damage characterization in various types of composite plates.},

abstract = {In this paper results of numerical analysis of S0/A0 elastic wave mode conversion at discontinuities in glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) plates are presented. Analysis of S0/A0 mode conversion effect at Teflon inserts simulating delamination (circular Teflon inserts located at a different depth, Teflon inserts with different shapes at the same depth) and impact damage with energies 5 J, 10 J and 15 J is conducted. Numerical analysis is based on spectral element method (SEM) in the time domain. Numerical model includes a composite plate, a piezoelectric transducer and bonding layer for transducer and damage. Numerical model takes also into account the influence of material damping. Numerical results are compared with experimental results based on full wavefield measurements using scanning laser Doppler vibrometry (SLDV). It is shown that based on effects of S0/A0 mode conversion it is possible to detect the damage and determine its shape and size.},
