abstract = {This paper deals with a semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) method for modeling wave propagation in waveguides of arbitrary cross-section. The method simply requires the finite element discretization of the cross-section of the waveguide, and assumes harmonic motion along the wave propagation direction. The general SAFE technique is extended to account for viscoelastic material damping by allowing for complex stiffness matrices for the material. The dispersive solutions are obtained in terms of phase velocity, group velocity (for undamped media), energy velocity (for damped media), attenuation, and cross-sectional mode shapes. Knowledge of these properties is important in any structural health monitoring attempt that uses ultrasonic guided waves. The proposed SAFE formulation is applied to several examples, including anisotropic viscoelastic layered plates, composite-to-composite adhesive joints and railroad tracks. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Guided waves (GW) are very attractive in nondestructive technique applications (eg. Structural Health Monitoring) because of their ability to propagate at long range. In a structure made of composite materials, their propagation is complex due to material anisotropy and to their dispersive and multi-modal nature. Interpreting measurements of GW in such a structure requires a sound grasp of their behaviour. Here, the Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) method is used for studying GW propagation in viscoelastic multilayered anisotropic plates. Beside classical post-processing techniques used to compute the displacement, dispersion and slowness curves, the Poynting vector is also obtained, allowing us to study energy propagation in complex plate structures. Then, GW propagation in multilayered viscoelastic composite (C-epoxy) plates is studied; different stacking sequences typical of those used to build aeronautical parts are considered. Phase, energy velocities and attenuation are studied for different propagation directions and frequencies. It appears that symmetries of GW behaviour are complex: the axes of symmetry depicting this behaviour do not coincide with those of stacking sequences and depend on frequency. Modes appearing above the first cut-off frequency have such a complex behaviour that they cannot be used in practical applications. {\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},
