abstract = {We study an innovative experimental approach for the characterization of the elastic response of anisotropic composite materials by ultrasonic immersion tests. In particular the class of anisotropy and the elastic moduli can be determined starting from measurements of the velocities of ultrasonic waves propagating in suitable directions. To this aim we have designed and developed a goniometric ultrasonic test bench and a software for the management of the test and the processing of the acquired data. By employing this experimental device we determine in a non-destructive way the five elastic moduli of a transversely isotropic unidirectional CFRP composite. The experimental analyses are supported by numerical simulations which are useful for a deeper insight of the propagation phenomena and for enhancing the experimental strategies to be adopted. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Woven fabric has been recognized as one of the widely used materials in the aerospace industry. In order to effectively utilize this material, it is necessary to evaluate its mechanical properties. In this paper a three-dimensional multi-scaled modelling technique has been developed to investigate the linear elastic properties of single-ply opened-packing woven fabrics for pure tension and shear responses. This technique is accomplished by introducing a number of new three-dimensional macro- and micro-blocks. Thus, this technique can be considered as a full three-dimensional modelling technique. In order to verify the capability of this method, some theoretical and finite-element analysis (FEA) numerical studies were carried out for four types of opened-packing woven fabric unit cells. It was shown that there exists a good agreement between the theoretical results and those predicted using the FEA models. The trends of the stiffness and engineering elastic constants with n g , which denotes a warp (or weft) yarn is interlaced with every n g th weft (or warp) yarn, were also investigated. For the in-plane elastic properties, the present results correlate well with those available in the literature. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Typically, numerical simulations of Lamb wave propagation are done using material properties which originate from tensile testing. This approach is well established in relation to isotropic homogenous structures such as aluminium plates. However if this approach is used for woven composites such as carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP), inaccuracies can arise that stem from vastly different stress distributions, strain rates and amplitudes during Lamb wave propagation. In order to account for this, an approach is presented where the elastic properties in a numerical Lamb wave model are optimised to achieve good correlation between model predictions and experimental observations. Since the material properties are determined under a Lamb wave propagation regime, the strain rates and amplitudes are consistent with the intended modelling application. The approach is validated with an experimental case study involving a M18/G939 carbon-epoxy system. The methodology is shown to yield property estimates that furnish simulations that closely match observed behaviours. The optimised properties were significantly different to those supplied by the manufacturer, as much as 52{\%} for the in-plane stiffness. The findings demonstrate that large errors are possible if elastic properties determined using conventional quasi-static testing are used in Lamb wave simulations pertaining to woven composite materials.},

@article{Rogers1995,
abstract = {A nondestructive technique is described for the measurement of elastic constants of isotropic plates using ultrasonic Rayleigh-Lamb waves. The experimental method employs continuous harmonic waves and a pair of variable-angle contact transducers in pitch-catch mode. The phase velocity of the R-L waves at a particular frequency is determined from the phase shift over a measured path length. This simple experimental technique can measure phase velocity over the range 1-10 mm/mu s with an error of less than 0.5{\%} over a frequency range of 50 kHz-2 MHz. Individual symmetric and antisymmetric modes can be generated through the selection of transducer angle and frequency. Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for the material are calculated from measurements of frequency and phase velocity by a nonlinear least squares solution to the dispersion equations. The sensitivity of the nonlinear least squares function to the measurement region of the dispersion curve is investigated. It was found that estimations of material properties are more accurate and less sensitive to small experimental errors when only selected frequencies and R-L modes are used in the least squares calculation. This technique is demonstrated with several isotropic materials and with both thick (6 mm) and thin (0.8 mm) plates. Values for elastic constants determined by the contact transducer Lamb wave technique compare favorably with values measured using the pulse-echo-overlap method. The uncertainty in measurements of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio was less than 1{\%} and 2{\%}, respectively. The technique has advantages over more traditional methods for measuring elastic properties when it is desirable to use wavelengths greater than the plate thickness, when properties may vary with frequency, or when it is necessary to measure in-plane elastic properties of thin plate structures.},

abstract = {A new approach for numerical simulation of the wave propagation in a composite plate is presented in this paper. Problem is realized by the 2D-3D coupled time domain spectral element method. All components used in the simulation are decomposed from each other. A connection between them is guaranteed by the interface elements realized by Lagrange multipliers. With this type of scheme, one can avoid a modelling of all the components by the three-dimensional (3D) spectral elements. In particular, the computation time can be reduced by using two-dimensional (2D) elements for adhesive layer modelling. Otherwise, 3D elements are very inefficient because a convergence of Central Difference Time Integration Method applied for solving an equation of motion is strongly correlated with the size of the smallest element. Numerical calculations were performed for the composite plate modelled by the 3D solid elements with a piezoelectric transducer bonded to the plate by the adhesive layer modelled by 2D shell elements. The simulations were carried out for an adhesive layer of various thickness for the excitation frequency in the range of 50-200 kHz. The presented model was verified by experimental data obtained by the laser vibrometer.},

abstract = {The propagation characteristics of Lamb waves in composites, with emphasis on group velocity and characteristic wave curves, are investigated theoretically and experimentally. In particular, the experimental study focuses on the existence of multiple higher-order Lamb wave modes that can be observed from piezoelectric sensors by the excitation of ultrasonic frequencies. Using three-dimensional (3-D) elasticity theory, the exact dispersion relations governed by transcendental equations are numerically solved for an infinite number of possible wave modes. For symmetric laminates, a robust method by imposing boundary conditions on the mid-plane and top surface is proposed to separate symmetric and anti-symmetric wave modes. A new semi-exact method is developed to calculate group velocities of Lamb waves in composites. Meanwhile, three characteristic wave curves: velocity, slowness, and wave curves are adopted to analyze the angular dependency of Lamb wave propagation. The dispersive and anisotropic behavior of Lamb waves in a two different types of symmetric laminates is studied in detail theoretically. In the experimental study, two surface-mounted piezoelectric actuators are excited either symmetric or anti-symmetric wave modes with narrowband signals, and a Gabor wavelet transform is used to extract group velocities from arrival times of Lamb wave received by a piezoelectric sensor. In comparison with the results from the theory and experiment, it is confirmed that multiple higher-order Lamb waves can be excited from piezoelectric actuators and the measured group velocities agree well with those from 3-D elasticity theory. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A method based on fitting the theoretical dispersion curves of Lamb waves to experimental data is presented to determine the thickness and two independent elastic constants of aluminum plates a few millimeters thick. The waves are generated by means of the wedge method using a narrowband source, selecting the wedge angle and the acoustic frequency f so that mainly one mode is excited. A self-developed pulsed electronic speckle pattern interferometry system renders a two dimensional map of the out-of-plane acoustic displacement field at the plate surface, which allows an accurate measurement of the acoustic wavelength lambda(1). For any mode, the relation between lambda(1) and f depends on the three unknown parameters, so at least three experimental measurements (lambda(1i),f(i)) with different frequencies and/or different modes are required to calculate them. The suitability of different Lamb modes to determine each parameter when the others are known is studied, as well as the conditions that the experimental set of values must fulfill to calculate all three parameters. Numerous Lamb modes at different frequencies are generated in each plate, and a fitting is made based on the minimization of the error function, resulting in an accuracy better than 1{\%}.},

@article{Lamb1917,
abstract = {The theory of waves in an infinitely long cylindrical rod was discussed by Pochharnmer in 1876 in a well-known paper.* The somewhat simpler problem of two-dimensional waves in a solid bounded by parallel planes was considered by Lord Bayleighf and by the present writer{\^{}} in 1889. The main object in these various investigations was to verify, or to ascertain small corrections to, the ordinary theory of the vibrations of thin rods or plates, and the wave-length was accordingly assumed in the end to be great in comparison with the thickness. It occurred to me some time ago that a further examination of the two-dimensional problem was desirable for more than one reason. In the first place, the number of cases in which the various types of vibration of a solid, none of whose dimensions is regarded as small, have been studied is so restricted that any addition to it would have some degree of interest, if merely as a contribution to elastic theory. Again, modern seismology has suggested various questions relating to waves and vibrations in an elastic stratum imagined as resting on matter of a different elasticity and density. These questions naturally present great mathematical difficulties, and it seemed unpromising to attempt any further discussion of them unless the comparatively simple problem which forms the subject of this paper should be found to admit of a practical solution. In itself it has, of course, no bearing on the questions referred to. Even in this case, however, the period-equation is at first sight rather intractable, and it is only recently that a method of dealing with it (now. pretty obvious) has suggested itself. The result is to give, I think, a fairly complete view of the more important modes of vibration of an infinite plate, together with indications as to the character of the higher modes, which are of less interest. I may add that the numerical work has been greatly simplified by the help of the very full and convenient Tables of hyperbolic and circular functions issued by the Smithsonian Institution. || * 'Crelle,' vol. 81, p. 324 ; see also Love, 'Elasticity,' 1906, p. 275.

The dispersive solutions are obtained in terms of phase velocity, group velocity (for undamped media), energy velocity (for damped media), attenuation, and cross-sectional mode shapes. Knowledge of these properties is important in any structural health monitoring attempt that uses ultrasonic guided waves.

The first three natural frequencies of the lower resonant modes of the laminated composite plates were extracted from the modal testing data of the plates. The finite element method is used to perform the modal analysis of the laminated composite plates. An error function is established to measure the differences between the experimentally and theoretically predicted natural frequencies of the laminated composite plates. The identification of the material elastic constants of the laminated composite plates is formulated as a constrained minimization problem in which the elastic constants are determined by making the error function a global minimum. Test results of a number of laminated composite plates are used to illustrate the feasibility and applications of the proposed method},

The comparison of the results obtained by classical tests and those obtained with the proposed method shows that, for the determination of in-plane properties (elastic modulus, shear modulus, Poisson coefficient), the resonance of Lamb waves generated by Hertzian contact is an available nondestructive method, having the advantages of not requiring coupling fluid (20) Determination of Elastic Properties of CFRP Using Lamb Waves Resonant Spectroscopy.

abstract = {A novel approach is presented for the ultrasonic determination of the elastic constants in plate-like structures of an orthotropic material (e.g. composites) using a Time-of-Flight version of the Pulsed Ultrasonic Polar Scan (TOF P-UPS). A forward numerical model of the TOF P-UPS is coupled to an inversion algorithm, based on the genetic optimization principle, targeting the determination of the orthotropic elastic parameters, and the quality of the inversion is demonstrated for synthetic data representative for composites. The advantage of the new approach is that the presented TOF P-UPS inversion method does not require a priori knowledge about the symmetry class of the material, nor about the orientation of the main axes of symmetry. Furthermore, the TOF P-UPS inversion method yields an accurate characterization of the orthotropic elasticity tensor, even when applied to composite plates with small frequency-thickness ratios in which the traditional bulk wave approaches no longer hold. Finally, the robustness of the TOF P-UPS inversion method is demonstrated for noisy data by evaluating the results for a range of signal-to-noise ratios.},

abstract = {While most measurements previously were made on bulk samples, composite materials are often produced in the form of thin sheets ("skin"). For this type of material, the most important property is the in-plane elasto-aniso- tropic characteristic. To measure this, Lamb waves are fairly adequate. Thompson et al. [8] used low frequency flexural waves (A0 Lamb mode) in the direction of the axis of symmetry for study of honeycomb sandwich panels. For estimation of the stiffness of thin composite plates, it is reasonably adequate to use the low frequency S0 Lamb mode (plate mode). In this paper, the polar characteristics for phase and group velocities of the low frequency S0 Lamb mode were studied in unidirectional, two- directional, and quasi-isotropic graphite-epoxy composite panels. The results of the experimenta were compared with theoretical calculations. The main attention is given to the description of the measurement concepts. EXPERIMENTAL},

abstract = {A simplified 2D semi-analytical model based on a global matrix method is developed to investigate the dispersion characteristics of propagating guided wave (GW) modes in multilayered composite laminates due to transient surface excitations. A relatively thin symmetric eight layered cross-ply composite laminate subjected to both narrowband and broadband surface excitations is considered. The displacements and stresses in individual laminae are 'exactly' represented in the frequency-wavenumber domain in terms of four unknown constants in each layer, which are then solved by applying the interface continuity conditions and the stress conditions on the free surfaces. Spatial and time domain solutions are obtained after evaluating the wavenumber integral followed by frequency inversion using the fast Fourier transform. It is shown that the wavenumber integral technique can be exploited to obtain the far-field time domain solution for a specific propagating mode in order to study its influence on the response signal. The far-field time histories of the out-of-plane displacements due to vertical surface excitations are calculated and compared with those obtained from finite element modeling using LS-DYNA, showing good agreement between the results. It is demonstrated that the theoretical model allows for separation and identification of individual propagating modes even for broadband excitations, where the effect of dispersion results in a strong shape distortion. However, the contribution of the A0 mode is found to dominate the out-of-plane motion due to vertical surface excitation for all cases considered. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Computational intelligence methods in the form of evolutionary algorithms and artificial immune systems are used to perform the identification procedure.

Compute-intensive operations are performed for a part of equation of motion derived at the degree of freedom level of 3D isopara-metric spectral elements. The assembly is performed at the force vector in such a way that atomic operations are minimized. This is achieved by a new mesh coloring technique The proposed parallel implementation of spectral element method on GPU is applied for the first time for Lamb wave simulations. It has been found that computation on multicore GPU is up to 14 times faster than on single CPU.},

The developed inversion technique is validated on synthetic data, yielding accurate results with small deviations: elasticity tensor {\textless}0.5{\%}, viscosity tensor {\textless}2{\%} and main axes of orthotropy {\textless}0.03°. The inversion procedure has been further applied to analyze actual experimental P-UPS recordings on an aluminum plate as well as a unidirectional [0]8 carbon/epoxy laminate. The obtained inversion results yield complex stiffness parameters which are in close agreement to reported values in literature, and confirms the potential of the UPS technique and its inversion optimization routine as an enhanced NDT technique to quickly and accurately obtain characteristic material properties of composites.},

A representative volume is chosen for each woven composite and the fibre architecture is described by several functions. To determine the effectiveness of this analysis, the elastic properties predicted for each woven composite are compared with experimental results and results extracted from the literature.

abstract = {Guided waves (GW) are very attractive in nondestructive technique applications (eg. Structural Health Monitoring) because of their ability to propagate at long range. In a structure made of composite materials, their propagation is complex due to material anisotropy and to their dispersive and multi-modal nature. Interpreting measurements of GW in such a structure requires a sound grasp of their behaviour. Here, the Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) method is used for studying GW propagation in viscoelastic multilayered anisotropic plates. Beside classical post-processing techniques used to compute the displacement, dispersion and slowness curves, the Poynting vector is also obtained, allowing us to study energy propagation in complex plate structures. Then, GW propagation in multilayered viscoelastic composite (C-epoxy) plates is studied; different stacking sequences typical of those used to build aeronautical parts are considered. Phase, energy velocities and attenuation are studied for different propagation directions and frequencies. It appears that symmetries of GW behaviour are complex: the axes of symmetry depicting this behaviour do not coincide with those of stacking sequences and depend on frequency. Modes appearing above the first cut-off frequency have such a complex behaviour that they cannot be used in practical applications. {\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},
