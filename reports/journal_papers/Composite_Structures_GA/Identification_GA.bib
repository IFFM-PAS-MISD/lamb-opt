@article{Rogers1995,
abstract = {A nondestructive technique is described for the measurement of elastic constants of isotropic plates using ultrasonic Rayleigh-Lamb waves. The experimental method employs continuous harmonic waves and a pair of variable-angle contact transducers in pitch-catch mode. The phase velocity of the R-L waves at a particular frequency is determined from the phase shift over a measured path length. This simple experimental technique can measure phase velocity over the range 1-10 mm/mu s with an error of less than 0.5{\%} over a frequency range of 50 kHz-2 MHz. Individual symmetric and antisymmetric modes can be generated through the selection of transducer angle and frequency. Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for the material are calculated from measurements of frequency and phase velocity by a nonlinear least squares solution to the dispersion equations. The sensitivity of the nonlinear least squares function to the measurement region of the dispersion curve is investigated. It was found that estimations of material properties are more accurate and less sensitive to small experimental errors when only selected frequencies and R-L modes are used in the least squares calculation. This technique is demonstrated with several isotropic materials and with both thick (6 mm) and thin (0.8 mm) plates. Values for elastic constants determined by the contact transducer Lamb wave technique compare favorably with values measured using the pulse-echo-overlap method. The uncertainty in measurements of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio was less than 1{\%} and 2{\%}, respectively. The technique has advantages over more traditional methods for measuring elastic properties when it is desirable to use wavelengths greater than the plate thickness, when properties may vary with frequency, or when it is necessary to measure in-plane elastic properties of thin plate structures.},

@article{Lamb1917,
abstract = {The theory of waves in an infinitely long cylindrical rod was discussed by Pochharnmer in 1876 in a well-known paper.* The somewhat simpler problem of two-dimensional waves in a solid bounded by parallel planes was considered by Lord Bayleighf and by the present writer{\^{}} in 1889. The main object in these various investigations was to verify, or to ascertain small corrections to, the ordinary theory of the vibrations of thin rods or plates, and the wave-length was accordingly assumed in the end to be great in comparison with the thickness. It occurred to me some time ago that a further examination of the two-dimensional problem was desirable for more than one reason. In the first place, the number of cases in which the various types of vibration of a solid, none of whose dimensions is regarded as small, have been studied is so restricted that any addition to it would have some degree of interest, if merely as a contribution to elastic theory. Again, modern seismology has suggested various questions relating to waves and vibrations in an elastic stratum imagined as resting on matter of a different elasticity and density. These questions naturally present great mathematical difficulties, and it seemed unpromising to attempt any further discussion of them unless the comparatively simple problem which forms the subject of this paper should be found to admit of a practical solution. In itself it has, of course, no bearing on the questions referred to. Even in this case, however, the period-equation is at first sight rather intractable, and it is only recently that a method of dealing with it (now. pretty obvious) has suggested itself. The result is to give, I think, a fairly complete view of the more important modes of vibration of an infinite plate, together with indications as to the character of the higher modes, which are of less interest. I may add that the numerical work has been greatly simplified by the help of the very full and convenient Tables of hyperbolic and circular functions issued by the Smithsonian Institution. || * 'Crelle,' vol. 81, p. 324 ; see also Love, 'Elasticity,' 1906, p. 275.

Families of curves are obtained for aluminum and zirconium. The distinguishing characteristics of the various modes are discussed in the light of potential nondestructive testing applications.

abstract = {A method based on fitting the theoretical dispersion curves of Lamb waves to experimental data is presented to determine the thickness and two independent elastic constants of aluminum plates a few millimeters thick. The waves are generated by means of the wedge method using a narrowband source, selecting the wedge angle and the acoustic frequency f so that mainly one mode is excited. A self-developed pulsed electronic speckle pattern interferometry system renders a two dimensional map of the out-of-plane acoustic displacement field at the plate surface, which allows an accurate measurement of the acoustic wavelength lambda(1). For any mode, the relation between lambda(1) and f depends on the three unknown parameters, so at least three experimental measurements (lambda(1i),f(i)) with different frequencies and/or different modes are required to calculate them. The suitability of different Lamb modes to determine each parameter when the others are known is studied, as well as the conditions that the experimental set of values must fulfill to calculate all three parameters. Numerous Lamb modes at different frequencies are generated in each plate, and a fitting is made based on the minimization of the error function, resulting in an accuracy better than 1{\%}.},

The method simply requires the finite element discretization of the cross-section of the waveguide, and assumes harmonic motion along the wave propagation direction. The general SAFE technique is extended to account for viscoelastic material damping by allowing for complex stiffness matrices for the material. The dispersive solutions are obtained in terms of phase velocity, group velocity (for undamped media), energy velocity (for damped media), attenuation, and cross-sectional mode shapes. Knowledge of these properties is important in any structural health monitoring attempt that uses ultrasonic guided waves.

@article{Taupin2011,
abstract = {Guided waves (GW) are very attractive in nondestructive technique applications (eg. Structural Health Monitoring) because of their ability to propagate at long range. In a structure made of composite materials, their propagation is complex due to material anisotropy and to their dispersive and multi-modal nature. Interpreting measurements of GW in such a structure requires a sound grasp of their behaviour. Here, the Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) method is used for studying GW propagation in viscoelastic multilayered anisotropic plates. Beside classical post-processing techniques used to compute the displacement, dispersion and slowness curves, the Poynting vector is also obtained, allowing us to study energy propagation in complex plate structures. Then, GW propagation in multilayered viscoelastic composite (C-epoxy) plates is studied; different stacking sequences typical of those used to build aeronautical parts are considered. Phase, energy velocities and attenuation are studied for different propagation directions and frequencies. It appears that symmetries of GW behaviour are complex: the axes of symmetry depicting this behaviour do not coincide with those of stacking sequences and depend on frequency. Modes appearing above the first cut-off frequency have such a complex behaviour that they cannot be used in practical applications. {\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The propagation characteristics of Lamb waves in composites, with emphasis on group velocity and characteristic wave curves, are investigated theoretically and experimentally. In particular, the experimental study focuses on the existence of multiple higher-order Lamb wave modes that can be observed from piezoelectric sensors by the excitation of ultrasonic frequencies. Using three-dimensional (3-D) elasticity theory, the exact dispersion relations governed by transcendental equations are numerically solved for an infinite number of possible wave modes. For symmetric laminates, a robust method by imposing boundary conditions on the mid-plane and top surface is proposed to separate symmetric and anti-symmetric wave modes. A new semi-exact method is developed to calculate group velocities of Lamb waves in composites. Meanwhile, three characteristic wave curves: velocity, slowness, and wave curves are adopted to analyze the angular dependency of Lamb wave propagation. The dispersive and anisotropic behavior of Lamb waves in a two different types of symmetric laminates is studied in detail theoretically. In the experimental study, two surface-mounted piezoelectric actuators are excited either symmetric or anti-symmetric wave modes with narrowband signals, and a Gabor wavelet transform is used to extract group velocities from arrival times of Lamb wave received by a piezoelectric sensor. In comparison with the results from the theory and experiment, it is confirmed that multiple higher-order Lamb waves can be excited from piezoelectric actuators and the measured group velocities agree well with those from 3-D elasticity theory. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A simplified 2D semi-analytical model based on a global matrix method is developed to investigate the dispersion characteristics of propagating guided wave (GW) modes in multilayered composite laminates due to transient surface excitations. A relatively thin symmetric eight layered cross-ply composite laminate subjected to both narrowband and broadband surface excitations is considered. The displacements and stresses in individual laminae are 'exactly' represented in the frequency-wavenumber domain in terms of four unknown constants in each layer, which are then solved by applying the interface continuity conditions and the stress conditions on the free surfaces. Spatial and time domain solutions are obtained after evaluating the wavenumber integral followed by frequency inversion using the fast Fourier transform. It is shown that the wavenumber integral technique can be exploited to obtain the far-field time domain solution for a specific propagating mode in order to study its influence on the response signal. The far-field time histories of the out-of-plane displacements due to vertical surface excitations are calculated and compared with those obtained from finite element modeling using LS-DYNA, showing good agreement between the results. It is demonstrated that the theoretical model allows for separation and identification of individual propagating modes even for broadband excitations, where the effect of dispersion results in a strong shape distortion. However, the contribution of the A0 mode is found to dominate the out-of-plane motion due to vertical surface excitation for all cases considered. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Typically, numerical simulations of Lamb wave propagation are done using material properties which originate from tensile testing. This approach is well established in relation to isotropic homogenous structures such as aluminium plates. However if this approach is used for woven composites such as carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP), inaccuracies can arise that stem from vastly different stress distributions, strain rates and amplitudes during Lamb wave propagation. In order to account for this, an approach is presented where the elastic properties in a numerical Lamb wave model are optimised to achieve good correlation between model predictions and experimental observations. Since the material properties are determined under a Lamb wave propagation regime, the strain rates and amplitudes are consistent with the intended modelling application. The approach is validated with an experimental case study involving a M18/G939 carbon-epoxy system. The methodology is shown to yield property estimates that furnish simulations that closely match observed behaviours. The optimised properties were significantly different to those supplied by the manufacturer, as much as 52{\%} for the in-plane stiffness. The findings demonstrate that large errors are possible if elastic properties determined using conventional quasi-static testing are used in Lamb wave simulations pertaining to woven composite materials.},

abstract = {The identification of material elastic constants of laminated composite plates using measured natural frequencies is studied. The first three natural frequencies of the lower resonant modes of the laminated composite plates were extracted from the modal testing data of the plates. The finite element method is used to perform the modal analysis of the laminated composite plates. An error function is established to measure the differences between the experimentally and theoretically predicted natural frequencies of the laminated composite plates. The identification of the material elastic constants of the laminated composite plates is formulated as a constrained minimization problem in which the elastic constants are determined by making the error function a global minimum. Test results of a number of laminated composite plates are used to illustrate the feasibility and applications of the proposed method},

abstract = {We describe an ultrasonic technique for the determination of the dynamic elastic moduli of fiber-reinforced composites through the analysis of guided wave speeds in laboratory specimens in the form of laminates. The wave speeds are measured by means of the leaky wave technique. A functional relationship, called the dispersion equation, Lamb (LLW) between the guided wave speed in the laminate, frequency and the dynamic elastic moduli of the material is derived through the use of a recently developed theoretical procedure. For a given set of data, the relationship is inverted by means of a systematic scheme to obtain the elastic constants of the material.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic guided waves in solid media have become a critically important subject in nondestructive testing and structural health monitoring, as new faster, more sensitive, and more economical ways of looking at materials and structures have become possible. This book will lead to fresh creative ideas for use in new inspection procedures. Although the mathematics is sometimes sophisticated, the book can also be read by managers without detailed understanding of the concepts as it can be read from a 'black box' point of view. Overall, the material presented on wave mechanics - in particular, guided wave mechanics - establishes a framework for the creative data collection and signal processing needed to solve many problems using ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation and structural health monitoring. The book can be used as a reference in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation by professionals and as a textbook for seniors and graduate students.

abstract = {While most measurements previously were made on bulk samples, composite materials are often produced in the form of thin sheets ("skin"). For this type of material, the most important property is the in-plane elasto-aniso- tropic characteristic. To measure this, Lamb waves are fairly adequate. Thompson et al. [8] used low frequency flexural waves (A0 Lamb mode) in the direction of the axis of symmetry for study of honeycomb sandwich panels. For estimation of the stiffness of thin composite plates, it is reasonably adequate to use the low frequency S0 Lamb mode (plate mode). In this paper, the polar characteristics for phase and group velocities of the low frequency S0 Lamb mode were studied in unidirectional, two- directional, and quasi-isotropic graphite-epoxy composite panels. The results of the experimenta were compared with theoretical calculations. The main attention is given to the description of the measurement concepts. EXPERIMENTAL},

abstract = {Aims and Scope of the Series The fundamental questions arising in mechanics are: Why?, How?, and How much? The aim of this series is to provide lucid accounts written by authoritative researchers giving vision and insight in answering these questions on the subject of mechanics as it relates to solids. The scope of the series covers the entire spectrum of solid mechanics. Thus it includes the foundation of mechanics; variational formulations; computational mechanics; statics, kinematics and dynamics of rigid and elastic bodies: vibrations of solids and structures; dynamical systems and chaos; the theories of elasticity, plasticity and viscoelasticity; composite materials; rods, beams, shells and membranes; structural control and stability; soils, rocks and geomechanics; fracture; tribology; experimental mechanics; biomechanics and machine design. The median level of presentation is the first year graduate student. Some texts are mono-graphs defining the current state of the field; others are accessible to final year under-graduates; but essentially the emphasis is on readability and clarity. For a list of related mechanics titles, see final pages.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The proposed spectral element method implementation is based on sparse matrix storage of local shape func-tion derivatives calculated at GaussâLobatto â Legendre points. The algorithm utilizes two basic operations: multiplication of sparse matrix by vector and element-by-element vectors multiplication. Compute-intensive operations are performed for a part of equation of motion derived at the degree of freedom level of 3D isopara-metric spectral elements. The assembly is performed at the force vector in such a way that atomic operations are minimized. This is achieved by a new mesh coloring technique The proposed parallel implementation of spectral element method on GPU is applied for the first time for Lamb wave simulations. It has been found that computation on multicore GPU is up to 14 times faster than on single CPU.},
