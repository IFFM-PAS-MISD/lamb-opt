		Typically, material properties originate from destructive tests and are used in computational models in the design and analysis process of structures. This approach is well-established in relation to isotropic homogenous materials. However, if this approach is used for composite laminates, inaccuracies can arise that leads to vastly different stress distributions, strain rates, natural frequencies, and velocities of propagating elastic waves. In order to account for this problem, the alternative method is proposed, which utilizes Lamb wave propagation phenomenon and optimization technique. Propagating Lamb waves are highly sensitive to changes in material parameters and are often used for structural health monitoring of structures. In the proposed approach, the elastic constants, which are utilized to determine dispersion curves of Lamb waves, are optimized to achieve a good correlation between model predictions and experimental observations. In the first step of this concept, parametric studies have been carried out in which the influence of mass density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio of reinforcing fibres as well as matrix of composite laminate and volume fraction of reinforcing fibres on dispersion curves of Lamb waves was investigated. The effective elasticity constants were calculated by using micromechanics and homogenization techniques considering variability of properties of composite constituents. The dispersion curves of Lamb wave were calculated by using semi-analytical spectral element method. The resulting dispersion curves were also compared with experimental measurements of full wavefield data conducted by scanning Doppler laser vibrometer and processed by 3D Fourier transform. Elastic constants were further optimized by using genetic algorithm which resulted in good correlation between numerical and experimental dispersion curves.

	\section{Introduction}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	Elastic constant values are often difficult to obtain, especially for anisotropic media. These values are indispensable for the design of a structure which fulfils assumed requirements (strength, stiffness, vibration characteristics). For years elastic constants of isotropic materials have been estimated during destructive testing and strain gauge or static displacement recordings~\cite{Wang2000}. Similar results can be achieved by dynamic tests which rely on natural frequencies~\cite{Wang2000a, Wesolowski2009,Beluch2014}. Measurements of velocities of bulk waves (longitudinal and shear) can also be used for determination of elastic constants~\cite{Rose1999}.
	
	For anisotropic media, determining the elastic constants is more complex. Destructive testing can still be used to determine some of the constants. Additional constants can be obtained by special cube-cutting procedures followed by destructive testing~\cite{Rose1991} or by using bulk wave measurement protocol for orthotropic media~\cite{Rose1999}. However, such experiments are cumbersome and expensive.  It should be noted that other ultrasonic methods exist such as leaky Lamb wave technique. In this technique, a specimen is immersed in a liquid tank and insonified with an acoustic beam at various incident angles and frequencies. The obtained pattern provides unique fingerprint of the underlying mechanical elasticity tensor at the insonified material spot.The method has been improved over the years by using the pulsed ultrasonic polar scan and inverse methods~\cite{Kersemans2014}. Due to simplicity, non-destructive methods based on one-sided Lamb wave propagation measurements have been evolving over the years.
	
	Lamb waves were named after their discoverer, Horace Lamb, who developed the theory of their propagation in 1917~\cite{Lamb1917}. Interestingly, Lamb was not able to physically generate the waves he discovered. This was achieved by Worlton~\cite{Worlton1961} in 1961, who also noticed their potential usefulness for damage detection. Lamb waves are defined as a type of elastic waves that propagate in infinite media bounded by two surfaces and arise as a result of the superposition of multiple reflections of longitudinal waves and shear vertical waves from the bounding surfaces. In the case of these waves, medium particle oscillations are very complex in character. Depending on the distribution of displacements on the top and bottom bounding surface, two modes of Lamb waves appear: symmetric, denoted as S0, S1, S2, …, and antisymmetric, denoted as A0, A1, A2, … One should note that the number of these modes is infinite.
	
	The analytic solution proposed by Lamb is limited to isotropic materials and infinite, unbounded media. The solution has highly nonlinear character, and numerical methods must be used to obtain dispersion curves. The numerical approach, based on Lamb solution, for calculation of dispersion curves for isotropic materials, can be found in a book by Rose~\cite{Rose1999}.
	
	Many studies have been devoted to the calculation of dispersion curves of Lamb waves propagating in composite laminates but only a few are related to the identification of elastic constants. Rose et al.~\cite{Rose1987} investigated Lamb wave propagation in unidirectional, two-directional, and quasi-isotropic graphite-epoxy composite panels. They derived polar characteristics of phase and group velocities of the low-frequency S0 Lamb mode. Mal et al.~\cite{Mal1993} and Karim et al.~\cite{Karim1990} determined dynamic elastic moduli of the fibre-reinforced composite. The elastic constants were derived by inversion of a set of data measured by the leaky Lamb wave technique. In 1995 Rogers~\cite{Rogers1995} proposed a technique to measure the isotropic elastic constants of plate materials using Rayleigh-Lamb waves. In his paper, he presents the effect of an increase in longitudinal wave velocities or changes in Young’s modulus or Poisson’s ratio on the dispersion curves.
	
	De\`an et al.~\cite{Dean2008} determined elastic constants and thickness of the aluminium by minimizing the error function comprised by the theoretical dispersion curves of Lamb waves and experimental data. They utilized full-field wavelength measurements of single-mode narrowband Lamb waves. Grinberg et al.~\cite{Grimberg2010} determined in-plane material parameters of CFRP from the equations for phase velocity of S0 and A0 modes at low-frequency range. 
	The paper by Bartoli et al.~\cite{Bartoli2006} deals with a semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) method for modelling wave propagation in waveguides of arbitrary cross-section. The method simply requires the finite element discretization of the cross-section of the waveguide and assumes harmonic motion along the wave propagation direction. The general SAFE technique is extended to account for viscoelastic material damping by allowing for complex stiffness matrices for the material. The dispersive solutions are obtained in terms of phase velocity, group velocity (for undamped media), energy velocity (for damped media), attenuation, and cross-sectional mode shapes. Taupin et al.~\cite{Taupin2011} applied the SAFE method to analyse composite laminate of various stacking sequences.
	
	A new semi-analytical method using 3-D elasticity theory was derived by Wang and Juan~\cite{Wang2007}. In comparison with the results of the theory and experiment, it was confirmed that multiple higher-order Lamb waves could be excited from piezoelectric actuators and the measured group velocities agree well with those from 3-D elasticity theory. The thin quasi-isotropic laminate was investigated only.
	
	Pol and Banerjee~\cite{Pol2013} derived a simplified 2D semi-analytical model based on a global matrix method to investigate the dispersion characteristics of propagating guided wave modes in multilayered composite laminates due to transient surface excitations. A relatively thin symmetric eight layered cross-ply composite laminate subjected to both narrowband and broadband surface excitations was considered. Comparison of group velocity curves obtained from developed model and LS-DYNA has shown good agreement.
	
	The paper by Beluch and Burczyński~\cite{Beluch2014} deals with the two-scale approach to the identification of material constants in composite materials. Structures made of unidirectionally fibre-reinforced composites are examined. However, for optimization of elastic constants, static displacements and eigenfrequencies are used, not Lamb wave data. Additionally, plane strain state was assumed in the model.
	
	In 2016 Ong et al.~\cite{Ong2016} proposed a technique for determination of elastic properties of the woven composite panel using the Lamb wave dispersion characteristics. The investigated CFRP panel comprised of 16 plies with such a sequence so that it could be treated as quasi-isotropic material. Simple 2D plane strain model was assumed in the numerical simulations. The material properties were found by fitting dispersion curves from a numerical simulation with experimental data by the particle swarm optimisation method. 
	
	From the review of the literature, no research evidence was found to date which deals with the rapid and robust identification of elastic material properties of highly anisotropic composite structures. Therefore, it is essential to develop a robust material identification methodology for the inspection of a wide range of composite structures. Moreover, there is no method which enables online tracking of changes in elastic material properties.
	
	The subject of this study focuses exclusively on an approach in which access to only one side of the specimen is required. In the proposed approach, dispersion curves of Lamb waves are utilized for determination of elastic constants in composite laminates. The paper is organized as follows: section~\ref{sec:dispersion_curves} describe numerical method for calculation of dispersion curves in laminated composites, section~\ref{sec:experiment} is related to extraction of dispersion curves from full wavefield measurements, section~\ref{sec:optimization} describes optimization of elastic constants by using genetic algorithm (GA) followed by conclusions.
	
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%	
\section{Dispersion curves of guided waves \label{sec:dispersion_curves}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Lamb wave dispersion phenomenon is related to wavenumber $k$ dependency on frequency $f$. 
Lamb wave dispersion curves depend on elasticity constants of the material in which Lamb waves propagate. 
Moreover, in composite laminates, dispersion curves depend the angle of propagation~\cite{Rose1999}. 
Therefore, these dependencies can be used for determination of elastic constants of composite laminates~\cite{Kudela2020}.
However, efficient model is needed for calculation of dispersion curves for a given material properties.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Semi-analytical model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Since the time-domain spectral element method (SEM) model~\cite{Kudela2020a} usually contains a large number of degrees of freedom, it is difficult to incorporate it into optimisation process – computation of dispersion curves, which are a part of an objective function, would take too long. 
Therefore, Lamb wave dispersion characteristics are computed using a modified semi-analytical finite element method~\cite{Bartoli2006,Marzani2008}. 
The modification consists of the replacement of uniformly distributed nodes across the thickness by Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) spectral nodes. 
Hence, we refer to the modified semi-analytical model as semi-analytical spectral element (SASE) model.
	
The mathematical model is presented here for the case of a plate-like waveguide as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:layered_composite_SASE}.  
The waveguide made of orthotropic material is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:layered_composite_SASE} in which reinforcing fibres are at angle $\theta$ in respect to $z$ axis.
One-dimensional spectral elements are applied through the thickness of a laminate, preserving wave equation in the propagation direction.  
Four-node spectral element is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:layered_composite_SASE}. 
It has non-uniform distribution of nodes which coincide with GLL points and three degrees of freedom per node.

	%\includegraphics{layered_composite_SASE.png}	
	\caption{SASE model of wave propagation along with degrees of freedom of a one-dimensional four-node spectral element.}
	\label{fig:layered_composite_SASE}
\end{figure}
	
Additionally, according to the concept proposed by Taupin et~al.~\cite{Taupin2011}, equations for dispersion curves are derived so that the solution can be obtained for arbitrary angle of propagation $\beta$ shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:layered_composite_SASE}. 
The wave propagation direction corresponds to the wavevector $\vect{k}$ defined as:
	
\begin{equation}
	\vect{k} = k \cos (\beta)\hat{ \vect{x}} + k \sin (\beta) \hat{\vect{y}},
	\label{eq:wavevector}
\end{equation}
where \(\hat{ \vect{x}}\) and \(\hat{\vect{y}}\) are unit vectors. 	
The general wave equation has a form of eigenvalue problem:

\begin{equation}
	\left[\matr{A} - \omega^2\matr{M} \right] \vect{U} =0,
	\label{eq:eig_dispersion}
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $\matr{M}$ is the mass matrix, $\matr{U}$ is the nodal displacement vector, and the matrix $\matr{A}$ can be defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	\matr{A} & =  k^2\left(s^2 \,\matr{K}_{22} + c^2\, \matr{K}_{33} - c s\, \matr{K}_{23} - c s\, \matr{K}_{32}\right) \\
	& + i k\, \matr{T}^T\left(-c\, \matr{K}_{13} - s\, \matr{K}_{21} + s\, \matr{K}_{12} + c\, \matr{K}_{31}\right) \matr{T} +\matr{K}_{11},
	\end{aligned}
	\label{eq:dispersion}
\end{equation}
where  $s = \sin(\beta)$, $c = \cos(\beta)$, $i = \sqrt{-1}$, and $\beta$ is the angle of guided wave propagation. 
The transformation matrix $\matr{T}$ is diagonal and it is introduced in order to eliminate imaginary elements from Eq.~(\ref{eq:dispersion}) (see~\cite{Bartoli2006} for more details). 
It should be noted that the system of equations~(\ref{eq:eig_dispersion}) explicitly depends on the angle $\beta$. 
Predicting the anisotropic behaviour of guided wave properties makes it necessary to loop over $\beta$ for each direction considered.
	
Stiffness matrices $\matr{K}_{mn}$ from Eq.~(\ref{eq:dispersion}) depend on elastic constants of composite laminate $\matr{C}$ and relations between displacements and strains. 
The definitions of these matrices on an elemental level are:
\begin{equation}
	\matr{K}_{mn}^e= \int \limits_{(e)} \matr{B}_m^{T} \matr{C}_{\theta}^e \, \matr{B}_n\, \ud z, 
	\label{eq:stiffness_matrix_e}
\end{equation}
where \(\matr{C}_{\theta}\) is the elastic tensor at element (e) transformed by an angle \(\theta\) according to a stacking sequence: $ \matr{C}_{\theta}= \matr{R}_1(\theta) \,\matr{C} \,\matr{R}_2^{-1}(\theta)$; \(\matr{B}\) is the matrix relating displacements and strains.
More detailed derivation can be found in~\cite{Kudela2020}. 

The matrix of elastic constants of an orthotropic linear elastic material can be written as:
\begin{equation}
	\matr{C} = \left[\begin{array}{cccccc} C_{11} & C_{12}& C_{13} & 0&0&0\\[2pt]
		C_{12}& C_{22} & C_{23}& 0&0&0\\[2pt]
		C_{13}&C_{23}&C_{33}&0&0&0\\[2pt]
		0& 0 &0&C_{44}& 0&0\\[2pt]
		0&0&0&0&C_{55}&0\\[2pt]
		0&0&0&0&0&C_{66}
	\end{array}\right]. 
	\label{eq:elastic_constatns}
\end{equation} 
It means that there are 9 independent coefficients which should be determined by using an inverse method. 
	
Equation~(\ref{eq:eig_dispersion}) can be solved numerically in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
	\item as a standard eigenvalue problem $\omega (k)$ (assuming given real values of wavenumbers $k$)
	\item as a second-order polynomial eigenvalue problem $k(\omega)$ for given frequencies $\omega$.
\end{itemize}
In the former case, the standard eigenvalue problem has a form:
\begin{equation}
	\left[\matr{A} - \omega^2\matr{M} \right]_{m} \vect{U} =0,
	\label{eq:eig_standard}
\end{equation}
in which the number of equations is $m$.
In the later case, the solution consist of recasting Eq.~(\ref{eq:eig_standard}) to a first-order eigensystem by doubling its algebraic size:
\begin{equation}
	\left[\hat{\matr{A}} - k \hat{\matr{D}} \right]_{2m} \hat{\vect{Q}} =0,
	\label{eq:eig_poly}
\end{equation}  
where
\begin{equation*}
	\hat{\vect{Q}} =\left[\begin{array}{c} 
		\vect{U}\\
		k \vect{U}
	\end{array} \right]
\end{equation*}
\begin{flalign*}
	&\hat{\matr{A}} =\left[\begin{array}{cc} 
		0 & \matr{K}_{11} - \omega^2 \matr{M}\\
		\matr{K}_{11} - \omega^2 \matr{M} & -i \left( c	\, \matr{K}_{13} - s\, \matr{K}_{12}  + s\, \matr{K}_{21} - c \, \matr{K}_{31}   \right)
	\end{array} \right]   \\
	&\hat{\matr{D}} =\left[\begin{array}{cc} 
		\matr{K}_{11} - \omega^2 \matr{M} & 0\\
		0& - \left( s^2 \, \matr{K}_{22} + c^2 \,  \matr{K}_{33}  -s c \,  \matr{K}_{23}  -sc \, \matr{K}_{32}  \right)
	\end{array} \right]
\end{flalign*}
The obtained wavenumbers are then of a complex character. 
It provides information about both the wave dispersion (real part of the wavenumbers) and the attenuation of the waves (imaginary part of the wave numbers). 
Unfortunately, solving a second‐order polynomial eigenvalue problem is about 10 times more costly than solving a standard eigenvalue problem. 

Linear frequencies $f=\omega/(2 \pi)$ will be used in next sections instead of angular frequencies $\omega$ for easier interpretation of figures.

\section{Strategies for determination of material properties \label{sec:strategies}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Dispersion curves calculated numerically must be accompanied by experimental counterpart to build appropriate objective function. 
In this paper we consider guided waves acquired at dense grid of points on the surface of a plate which forms full wavefield data set. 

Full wavefield data set can be acquired by scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (SLDV).
The data set is a 3D matrix representing spatial dimensions $x$, $y$ and the time $t$. 
3D Fourier transform leads to wavenumber-wavenumber-frequency representation  in the Cartesian coordinate system ($k_x$, $k_y$, $f$) or wavenumber-angle-frequency representation  in the cylindrical coordinate system ($k$, $\beta$, $f$).

Three strategies can be applied:
\begin{itemize}
	\item utilise data set at selected angle slices,
	\item utilise data set at selected frequency slices,
	\item use mixed approach (not considered here).
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Selected angle slices}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The slices of wavenumber-wavenumber-frequency data at selected wave propagation angles ($\beta=30^{\circ}$, $\beta=90^{\circ}$) are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:angle_slice}. 
The slices reveal patterns which represent characteristic dispersion curves. 
Corresponding numerical dispersion curves can be computed quite fast by the semi-analytic method by swept over real wavenumber range.
Equation~(\ref{eq:eig_standard}) is used in this strategy.
The following wave propagation angles were considered in this paper: 0$^{\circ}$, 15$^{\circ}$, 30$^{\circ}$, 45$^{\circ}$, 60$^{\circ}$, 75$^{\circ}$ and 90$^{\circ}$.
\begin{figure} [h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{figure2.png}	
	\caption{Experimental wavenumber-wavenumber-frequency data sliced at chosen angles ($\beta=30^{\circ}$ and $\beta=90^{\circ}$).}
	\label{fig:angle_slice}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Selected frequency slices}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The data slices at frequencies 100 kHz and 350 kHz are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:freq_slice}. 
The elliptic-like pattern of wavenumbers is visible (wavenumber surface).
In this case Eq.~(\ref{eq:eig_poly}) is more appropriate for calculation of equivalent numerical wavenumber profiles but it requires longer computation time as mentioned before.
The following frequency slices were considered in this paper: 48.85, 98.94, 149.04, 199.14, 249.24, 299.33 and 349.43~kHz giving the same number of slices as in the case of angle slices.
\begin{figure} [h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{figure3.png}	
	\caption{Experimental wavenumber-wavenumber-frequency data sliced at chosen frequencies (100 kHz and 350 kHz).}
	\label{fig:freq_slice}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Objective function}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The objective function consists of two parts: experimental which is in the form of an image and semi-analytical which is in the form of points which forms dispersion curves (or wavenumber profiles) calculated for the given elastic constants $C_{11}$, $C_{12}$, $C_{13}$, $C_{22}$, $C_{23}$, $C_{33}$, $C_{44}$, $C_{55}$ and $C_{66}$.
The semi-analytical dispersion characteristics (dispersion curves or wavenumber profiles) are converted to a binary image of the same resolution as in the experiment. 
In this way, we have experimental images and semi-analytical images of dispersion characteristics at selected angles of propagation. 
Semi-analytical images are used as filter masks for experimental images.
If dispersion curves from the SASE model align well with high values of experimental images, it leads to high values in the filtered image and vice versa.
Sum over pixel values of resultant image is used as an objective function (see \cite{Kudela2020} for more details).
The objective function depending on optimisation strategy can be written as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item angle slice
\begin{equation}
	F=\min \frac{(-1)}{n_k \, n_f} \cdot \sum_{\beta} \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} \sum_{j=1}^{n_f} (D_{\beta}^{SASE})_{ij} \, \cdot (D_{\beta}^{EXP})_{ij},
	\label{eq:obj_fun_beta}
\end{equation}
where \(n_k\) is the number of wavenumber points and \(n_f\) is the number of frequency points, $\matr{D}_{\beta}^{SASE}$ is the binary image of dispersion curves calculated by the SASE model for the angle $\beta$ and $\matr{D}_{\beta}^{EXP}$ is the experimental image of wavenumber-wavenumber-frequency data sliced at angle $\beta$.

\item frequency slice

\begin{equation}
	F=\min \frac{(-1)}{n_k \, n_{\beta}} \cdot \sum_{f} \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} \sum_{j=1}^{n_{\beta}} (D_{f}^{SASE})_{ij} \, \cdot (D_{f}^{EXP})_{ij},
	\label{eq:obj_fun_freq}
\end{equation}
where \(n_k\) is the number of wavenumber points and \(n_{\beta}\) is the number of angles, $\matr{D}_{f}^{SASE}$ is the binary image of wavenumber profiles calculated by the SASE model for the selected frequency $f$ and $\matr{D}_{f}^{EXP}$ is the experimental image of wavenumber-wavenumber-frequency data sliced at frequency $f$.
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Genetic algorithm parameters}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The Sheffield Genetic Algorithm Toolbox for Matlab developed at the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering at The University of Sheffield was used for the optimisation~\cite{Chipperfield1994}.
The genetic algorithm was used as an optimisation procedure due to the complex nature of the problem and form of the objective function. 
The objective function is non differentiable, hence gradient methods cannot be applied. 

It should be noted that the genetic algorithm can stuck in local minima causing unwanted premature convergence. 
The mutation rate of 0.05 along with random offspring generation every 100-th generation was employed to alleviate the problem.

The remaining genetic algorithm parameters were as follows: the number of individuals 100, the maximum number of generations 800, generation gap 0.7, precision 9 bits, crossover rate 0.7,  random offspring generation rate 0.1.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Specimen}
The investigated specimen had dimensions 1200 $\times$ 1200 mm and was made out of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP). 
The average thickness was 2.85 mm.
The total weight of the specimen was 6460 g, hence, based on the volume of the specimen, the density is about~1574.1~kg/m\textsuperscript{3}.
The specimen was composed of 40 layers of unidirectional prepregs stacked in one direction (90 degrees). 
NTPT thin prepregs 736LT 75~g/m$^2$ by North Thin Ply Technology and epoxy resin MP503Z-HT by Impregnatex Compositi were used for fabrication of the specimen.

The material properties of the specimen are given in Table~\ref{tab:mat_prop_uni}. 
It should be noted that only a few parameters are available in the specification delivered by the manufacturer. 
Other parameters were assumed as indicated in Table~\ref{tab:mat_prop_uni}.

\subsection{Experimental measurements \label{sec:SLDV}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% laser vibrometer mesurements
Lamb waves were excited by a piezoelectric disk (PZT) of diameter 10 mm attached to the back surface of the specimen. 
Chirp signal with the frequency range 0-500 kHz lasting 200 µs was generated every 10 ms and applied to the PZT element through the signal amplifier.
The specimen central area of 455 $\times$ 455 mm was measured in 499 $\times$ 499 points using SLDV (Polytec PSV-400). 
In every measurement point, 2048 time samples were registered with a sampling frequency of 1.28 MHz. The measurements were taken 20 times in every grid point and averaged to improve the signal to noise ratio.
The measurement results were stored as a 3D matrix of size 499 $\times$ 499 $\times$ 2048 points. 
Median filtering was applied to remove noise in spatial images. Next 3D Fourier transform was applied. 
The resulting matrix was used for the determination of elastic constants.

Additional measurements were taken to validate the SEM model. 
The same setup was used but instead of a chirp signal, Hann windowed signal was applied for excitation at carrier frequencies 16.5 kHz, 50 kHz and 100 kHz. 
Five cycles in signals were used for each case. 
Moreover, measurements were taken only in one-quarter of the specimen at a grid of 491 $\times$ 491 points.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Data processing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
3D Fourier Transform was applied to the full wavefield data in the space-time domain ($x$, $y$, $t$). 
Next 3D matrix was transformed from ($k_x$, $k_y$, $\omega$) coordinates to cylindrical coordinates ($k$, $\beta$, $f$). 
Interpolation was employed to obtain images $\matr{D}_{\beta}^{EXP}$ representing dispersion curves at selected angles $\beta = 0^{\circ} \ldots 90^{\circ}$ with the step of $15^{\circ}$. 
The size of the interpolated matrix $\matr{D}_{\beta}^{EXP}$ in the current approach was $n_k=512$ $\times$ $n_f= 512$. 
The result of this operation for selected angle slices is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:angle_slice}. 

Similarly, interpolation was employed to obtain images $\matr{D}_{f}^{EXP}$ representing wavenumber surfaces at frequencies 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240 and 280~kHz.
The size of the interpolated matrix $\matr{D}_{f}^{EXP}$ in the current approach was $n_k=512$ $\times$ $n_{\beta}= 512$.
The result of this operation for selected frequency slices is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:freq_slice}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Determination of elastic constants}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Two approaches were investigated: (i) rule of mixture followed by homogenisation based on material properties given in Table~\ref{tab:mat_prop_uni}, (ii) determination of elastic constants through the optimisation process described in section~\ref{sec:strategies}. 
The results of rule of mixture followed by homogenisation process is given in the second column of Table~\ref{tab:mat_prop_identified}.
The results of inversion by using $\beta$-slicing method and $f$-slicing method are given in third and fourth column of Table~\ref{tab:mat_prop_identified}, respectively.

	\label{tab:mat_prop_identified}
\end{table}
It can be noticed that optimised elastic properties given in Table~\ref{tab:mat_prop_identified} are significantly different than elastic constants estimated through homogenisation. 
The differences are as large as around 6\% for $C_{11}$ and up to 45\% for $C_{13}$ elastic constant.
These differences also contribute to differences in dispersion curves. 
Comparison of dispersion curves calculated by SASE method for homogenised material properties with dispersion curves calculated for optimised material properties is given in Figure 3. 
White dispersion curves are overlaid on experimental images. 
Red and yellow colours on experimental images resemble dispersion curves where on the horizontal axis is the frequency $f$ and on the vertical axis is the wavenumber $k$.

SASE curves calculated for the homogenised material properties are significantly overestimated at angle 0\(^{\circ}\) (in this case perpendicular to fibres) and slightly underestimated at angle 90° (parallel to fibres). 
The best fit is at about 45\(^{\circ}\). 
In contrast, SASE curves calculated for optimised material properties almost perfectly matches the red and yellow spots on experimental images. 
The objective function value $F$ is 97.11 for a homogenised case and 16.78 for the optimised case, respectively. 
In other words, the fitness of dispersion curves calculated by SASE model to experimental one is much better for the latter case (the lower $F$ means better fitness).

\subsection{SEM model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The goal was to model as accurately as possible full wavefield of guided waves which were acquired by the experimental setup at frequencies 16.5 kHz, 50 kHz and 100 kHz. 
The time-domain spectral element method was used in which a shell model based on the first-order shear deformation theory is implemented~\cite{Kudela2020a}. 
In this model, the composite laminate is represented only by a mid-surface. Therefore, equivalent elastic properties must be calculated. 

Elastic constants estimated by both methods are given in Table~\ref{tab:mat_prop_identified}. 
It should be noted that in the shell model, the assumption is made that the strain in the thickness direction is zero. 
Therefore only 6 of 9 constants given in Table~\ref{tab:mat_prop_identified} are required in the SEM model.

It should be added that the unstructured mesh of the SEM model was generated by using gmsh software~\cite{Geuzaine2009} rendering pzt disc at the centre where equivalent piezoelectric forces were applied. 
The mesh was tailored to the highest investigated carrier frequency to ensure at least 8 nodes per wavelength.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{SEM model accuracy analysis}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
It should be underlined that the SASE model is used in the optimisation algorithm. 
It enables to use one element per composite layer giving very accurate dispersion characteristics. The purpose of SEM model is different. 
It is used for full wavefield analysis and often analysis of the interaction of Lamb waves with defects. 
It requires a dense mesh of nodes. 
Since the representation of each layer of a composite laminate is prohibitive due to high computation cost, approximate theories are used. 
In the present approach, first-order shear deformation theory was applied. 
However, higher-order theories can be used as well (see~\cite{Ostachowicz2012}).

Since guided wave damage detection methods usually rely on fundamental Lamb wave modes, i.e. S0 and A0, accurate representation of these modes by the model is crucial.
We focus here on A0 mode analysis. 
In particular, transverse displacements are extracted from the SEM model and interpolated at the uniform grid of points so that the Fourier transform can be applied. 
Numerical full wavefield data sets calculated for the carrier frequencies 16.5~kHz, 50~kHz and 100~kHz were processed by the 3D Fourier transform and next combined. 
Due to the fact, that Hann windowed signal with 5 cycles has some frequency bandwidth, the combined image gives a good representation of A0 mode dispersion curve as presented in Figure 4.

Figure 4 shows the comparison of A0 mode dispersion images calculated by the SEM model for the homogenised material properties and optimised material properties obtained by $\beta$-slicing method as given in Table~\ref{tab:mat_prop_identified}. 
White A0 mode dispersion curves calculated by SASE model for optimised material properties obtained by $\beta$-slicing method are given as a reference. 
It is confirmed that homogenised material properties lead to significant error in dispersion curves which directly translate to errors in phase velocities given by relationship $c_p= f/k$.

It is important to note that despite low-order approximation of shell SEM, dispersion images match very well SASE dispersion curves (right column of Figure 4). 
Only slight discrepancies at higher frequencies (100~kHz) are visible. 
These discrepancies are consistent for each investigated angle of propagation – wavenumbers are underestimated, therefore phase velocities from SEM model are too high by about 0.7\%.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Full wavefield comparison}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Another visualisation is shown in Figure 5 to underlined the importance of accurate modelling of guided waves velocity. 
A frame of propagating waves is selected at the time instance 0.5~ms. 
Reinforcing fibres are located vertically, hence wavefront is elongated in the vertical direction.
The first image in Figure 5 shows that the application of homogenised material properties causes that the A0 mode reaches the left edge too fast. 
In contrast, the application of optimised material properties results in a wave pattern which is very similar to the experimental one except for wave crest amplitudes. 
The A0 mode calculated numerically based on elastic constants obtained by $\beta$-slicing method reaches the left edge at the same time as in the experiment.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Validation on quasi-isotropic CFRP plate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
It should be noted that despite excellent agreement between numerical and experimental dispersion curves reported in section~\ref{sec:modelling_improvement}, the correctness of elastic tensor $\matr{C}$ is not entirely proven.
Therefore, additional effort was made to validate its correctness.
The validation was conducted based on Open Guided Waves (OGW) data set which is accompanied by material properties obtained by various test standards~\cite{Moll2019}.
OGW is an extendable online platform where high-quality and well-documented datasets for guided wave-based inspections are provided.
\subsection{Specimen}
The benchmark structure used for validation was quasi-isotropic carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plate with embedded piezoelectric transducers. 
The layup was [45/0/-45/90/-45/0/45/90]\textsubscript{S}. 
CFRP plate had the dimensions of 500 mm \(\times\) 500 mm and a thickness of 2 mm 
(values provided by manufacturer). 
The actual measured average thickness was 2.086 mm. 
The diameter of the piezoelectric transducers was 10 mm and the thickness 0.2 mm. 
The specimen was made of prepreg material Hexply\textsuperscript{\textregistered} M21/34\%/UD134/T700/300. 
The established material properties by various test standards for unidirectional Hexply material are given in Table~\ref{tab:mat_prop_Moll}.

\end{table}
The matrix of elastic constants $\matr{C}$ was calculated based on the material properties given in Table~\ref{tab:mat_prop_Moll} and the formulas:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\nu_{ij}}{E_{ii}}=\frac{\nu_{ji}}{E_{jj}},\quad i,j=1,2,3\quad i\ne j
	\label{eq:recalc}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
	G_{23} = \frac{E_{22}}{2(1+\nu_{23})}
	\label{eq:recalc2}
\end{equation}
Also propagation of uncertainties was taken into account.

Experimental full wavefield measurements by using SLDV were conducted in similar manner as it was described in section~\ref{sec:SLDV}. 
However, only quarter of the plate was considered for 3D Fourier transform.

\section{Conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We presented the guided wave propagation framework which consists of two steps. 
In the first step, 9 elastic constants of the carbon-fibre-reinforced composite are determined through the optimisation process. 
Genetic algorithm is employed for optimisation of difference between dispersion curves obtained experimentally and dispersion curves calculated numerically by SASE method.
In the second step, full wavefield simulations were performed by using the time domain SEM. 
It has been shown that very good agreement can be obtained between SEM and experiment if optimised elastic constants are used. 
Such an approach is much preferred in comparison to homogenisation techniques because it leads to much lower errors in guided wave velocities.

Analysis of improvement in wave attenuation modelling and wave crest amplitude distribution through optimisation is a task which is planned in the future.

Furthermore, validation of correctness of the optimisation method was performed based on OGW data set.

 
	impose constraints on optimisation process so that obtain elastic constants of better physical meaning.
	In summary, the current implementation is very well suited for
