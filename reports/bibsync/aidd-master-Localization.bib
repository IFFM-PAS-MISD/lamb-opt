abstract = {Delamination in composite structures plays a major role in lowering structural strength and stiffness, consequently downgrading system integrity and reliability. A Lamb wave-based quantitative identification technique for delamination in CF/EP composite structures was established. Propagation of Lamb waves in a series of composite laminates, individually bearing a delamination, was evaluated using dynamic FEM analyses. Taking advantage of wavelet transform and artificial neural algorithms, an Intelligent Signal Processing and Pattern Recognition (ISPPR) package was developed, by which the spectrographic characteristics of simulated Lamb wave signals in the time-frequency domain were extracted and digitised as Digital Damage Fingerprints (DDF), to construct a Damage Parameters Database (DPD). The DPD was then used offline to train a multi-layer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) under supervision of an error-backpropagation (BP) algorithm. Assisted by an active online structural health monitoring (AO-SHM) system with an active piezoelectric actuator/sensor network, the proposed methodology was validated online by identifying actual delaminations in CF/EP (T650/F584) quasi-isotropic composite laminates. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Pneumonia is a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection of one or both sides of the lungs that causes lung alveoli to fill up with fluid or pus, which is usually diagnosed with chest x-rays. This work investigates opportunities for applying machine learning solutions for automated detection and localization of pneumonia on chest x-ray images. We propose an ensemble of two convolutional neural networks, namely RetinaNet and Mask R-CNN for pneumonia detection and localization. We validated our solution on a recently released dataset of 26,684 images from Kaggle Pneumonia Detection Challenge and were score among the top 3{\%} of submitted solutions. With 0.793 recall, we developed a reliable solution for automated pneumonia diagnosis and validated it on the largest clinical database publicity available to date. Some of the challenging cases were additionally examined by a team of physicians, who helped us to interpret the obtained results and confirm their practical applicability.},
