abstract = {Lamb waves exhibit conical dispersion at zero wave number when an accidental degeneracy occurs between thickness mode longitudinal and shear resonances of the same symmetry. Here we investigate the propagation of Lamb waves generated at the conical point frequency and the interaction of these waves with defects and interfaces. the group velocity and mode shapes of Lamb waves at the conical point are found, and it is shown that as the wavenumber gets close to zero, considerable group velocity is seen only for material properties supporting a degeneracy or near-degeneracy. the unusual wave propagation and mode conversion of Lamb waves generated at the conical point are elucidated through numerical simulations. experimental measurements of near conical point Lamb wave interaction with holes in a plate demonstrate that these waves flow around defects while maintaining a constant phase of oscillation across that plate surface. Lamb waves are guided waves that propagate through plates and are the result of reflection, refraction, and mode conversion of bulk waves from the plate surfaces. The theory of Lamb wave propagation is well established and Lamb waves have been used for a multitude of applications including nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of plates, structural health monitoring, and sensing systems 1-3. Lamb waves follow a complex dispersion relation described by the Rayleigh-Lamb equation, and the specific shape of the dispersion curves in a homogeneous, isotropic plate is dictated by the Poisson's ratio 4. For a given application, it is often advantageous to access specific Lamb wave modes with favorable propagation characteristics. For long-range inspection applications, for instance, Lamb waves with small group velocity dispersion are used in order to minimize wave packet spreading with propagation distance. For local measurements, one can excite Lamb waves at particular points on the dispersion curve where the group velocity goes to zero while the phase velocity remains finite. At such zero group velocity (ZGV) points, a strong and localized resonance can be excited and used, for example, to determine elastic properties, monitor adhesion, or track fatigue damage 5-16. ZGV points are common to both acoustic and optical waveguides and are the result of a repulsion between two modes near a wave vector (k) of zero that leads to backward wave propagation, or a wave propagation with counter-directed phase and group velocities, in one of the modes 17,18. The ZGV point is located at the transition between backward and forward wave propagation. The repulsion between modes is the strongest when an accidental degeneracy occurs 19. In the case of Lamb waves, this means that there is a coincidence between the frequencies of longitudinal and shear resonances of the same symmetry 20. A salient feature associated with accidental degeneracy is that the dispersion curve passes linearly through k = 0, allowing for a peculiar type of wave which propagates with an infinite wavelength but retains a finite group velocity. This wave propagates away from a source without a phase advance, producing a temporal oscillation of the plate that is uniform across the surface. Such behavior, evident in homogeneous elastic and optical waveguides, has also seen widespread attention in acoustic and optical "zero index" or "near zero index" metamaterials where linear dispersion, or conical dispersion in a three-dimensional sense, is achieved through a combination of materials structure and induced degeneracy 21-27. Recently, it was recognized and experimentally demonstrated that a simple, homogenous, aluminum plate shows linear dispersion through k = 0 at a particular Poisson's ratio where accidental degeneracy occurs 28,29. Degeneracy was induced by adjusting the elastic properties of the plate over a small range through temperature change. It was also shown that waves excited in a plate near k = 0, referred to as conical point waves, exhibited open 2 Scientific RepoRtS | (2019) 9:15216 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51187-9 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ angle independent mode conversion upon encountering a plate edge. Here, we derive the group velocity of conical point Lamb waves through implicit differentiation of the Rayleigh-Lamb equations, and provide the mode shapes as k approaches zero. We track the group velocity of modes at low k values and show that long wavelength Lamb waves can propagate with non-negligible group velocity only if the mechanical properties are such that degen-eracy or near-degeneracy on a given mode occurs. We provide a computational and experimental study of near conical point Lamb wave interaction with holes and other discontinuities in a plate and find that the near conical point waves flow around defects while maintaining a constant phase of oscillation across that plate surface. Mode conversion at a hole interface is nearly spatially isotropic, regardless of the position of the excitation source. We propose that conical point and near-conical point Lamb waves provide a facile means of investigating the physics of "zero index" wave propagation. In addition, for specific materials that exhibit near-degeneracy of modes with like symmetry, they could find application in the nondestructive characterization of elastic waveguides.
