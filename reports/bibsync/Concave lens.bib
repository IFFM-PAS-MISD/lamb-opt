abstract = {Ultrasonic testing is generally recognized as being the preferred nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method for measuring the size of cracks in metals, particularly when access is restricted. Using ultrasonic methods for structural health monitoring imposes the requirement of fixed transducers, which limits the articulation of transducers that is common for NDE. Here we consider the specific problem of in situ sizing of fatigue cracks emanating from fastener holes in aluminum structural components. A dual angle beam through transmission technique is employed whereby the regions of expected crack initiation are interrogated with vertically polarized shear waves. Fatigue cracks partially block the leaky creeping wave spiralling around the hole, and thus reduce the energy of the received signal. The reduction in received energy is directly related to the extent and shape of any open cracks, and this energy is modulated by the applied load as the cracks open and close. The ratio of energy received from the specimen under load to that received under no load is monitored, and this ratio is empirically related to the total crack area. A model is developed to explain this relationship for known crack shapes by assuming an ultrasonic energy profile in the plane of the crack. Data calculated from the model show very good agreement with the experimental results. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

abstract = {Several different strategies are being considered for ultrasonic structural health monitoring systems using a variety of approaches. Guided wave techniques for interrogating large plate-like structures have probably generated the most interest; these methods have the potential of monitoring large areas with a low sensor density while remaining sensitive to defects. The acousto-ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation method has motivated the use of long-time, reverberating waves which "fill" a structure and hence monitor large areas. Local methods based upon several different wave modes have been considered for monitoring known "hot spots" such as fastener holes and critical bonds. Presented here are examples of these three strategies where the purpose is to both show progress which has been made and illustrate key issues, mainly in the context of aerospace applications. The progress and problems thus far show both the promise of ultrasonic structural health monitoring and the significant challenges in moving from the laboratory to deployed systems.},

abstract = {We propose a theory of gradient index devices in plates that allow the simultaneous control of both S0 and A0 Lamb modes. This is in contrast to the existing approaches that are mainly limited to the manipulation of only the lowest A0 modes. These devices are based on phononic crystal plates, which are studied in the low frequency (homogenization) limit. We demonstrate a direct relationship between the dispersion relation of these two modes in phononic crystal plates that, together with the thickness dependence of the dispersion relation of the A0 mode, allows their simultaneous control. As a matter of illustration, a flat gradient index lens and a circular Luneburg lens are designed by means of the simultaneous variation of the inclusions' radii and the thickness of the plate. Numerical simulations show that the performance of these devices is good for the two modes in a broadband frequency region and that this approach can be used to design more advanced refractive devices for the total control of guided vibrational modes. Potential applications for the detection of small vibrations and energy harvesting devices are finally discussed.},

abstract = {Wave propagation can be manipulated at a deep subwavelength scale through the locally resonant metamaterial that possesses unusual effective material properties. Hyperlens due to metamaterial's anomalous anisotropy can lead to superior-resolution imaging. In this paper, a single-phase elastic metamaterial with strongly anisotropic effective mass density has been designed. The proposed metamaterial utilizes the independently adjustable locally resonant motions of the subwavelength-scale microstructures along the two principal directions. High anisotropy in the effective mass densities obtained by the numerical-based effective medium theory can be found and even have opposite signs. For practical applications, shunted piezoelectric elements are introduced into the microstructure to tailor the effective mass density in a broad frequency range. Finally, to validate the design, an elastic hyperlens made of the single-phase hyperbolic metamaterial is proposed with subwavelength longitudinal wave imaging illustrated numerically. The proposed single-phase hyperbolic metamaterial has many promising applications for high resolution damage imaging in nondestructive evaluation and structural health monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2016 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {The paper studies the interaction of Lamb waves with the free edge of a plate. The reflection coefficients of a Lamb mode at a plate free edge are calculated using a semi-analytical method, as a function of frequency and angle of incidence. The conversion between forward and backward Lamb modes is thoroughly investigated. It is shown that, at the zero-group velocity (ZGV) frequency, the forward {\$}S{\_}1{\$} Lamb mode fully converts into the backward {\$}S{\_}{\{}2b{\}}{\$} Lamb mode at normal incidence. Besides, this conversion is very efficient over most of the angular spectrum and remains dominant at frequencies just above the ZGV-point. This effect is observed experimentally on a Duralumin plate. Firstly, the {\$}S{\_}1{\$} Lamb mode is selectively generated using a transducer array, secondly the {\$}S{\_}{\{}2b{\}}{\$} mode is excited using a single circular transducer. The normal displacement field is probed with an interferometer. The free edge is shown to retro-focus the incident wave at different depths depending on the wave number mismatch between the forward and backward propagating modes. In the vicinity of the ZGV-point, wave numbers coincide and the wave is retro-reflected on the source. In this frequency range, the free edge acts as a perfect phase conjugating mirror.},

abstract = {Understanding and analysing the complex phenomena related to elastic wave propagation has been the subject of intense research for many years and has enabled application in numerous fields of technology, including structural health monitoring (SHM). In the course of the rapid advancement of diagnostic methods utilising elastic wave propagation, it has become clear that existing methods of elastic wave modeling and analysis are not always very useful; developing numerical methods aimed at modeling and analysing these phenomena has become a necessity. Furthermore, any methods developed need to be verified experimentally, which has become achievable with the advancement of measurement methods utilising laser vibrometry. Guided Waves in Structures for SHM reports on the simulation, analysis and experimental investigation related propagation of elastic waves in isotropic or laminated structures. The full spectrum of theoretical and practical issues associated with propagation of elastic waves is presented and discussed in this one study. Key features: Covers both numerical and experimental aspects of modeling, analysis and measurement of elastic wave propagation in structural elements formed from isotropic or composite materials. Comprehensively discusses the application of the Spectral Finite Element Method for modelling and analysing elastic wave propagation in diverse structural elements. Presents results of experimental measurements employing advanced laser technologies, validating the quality and correctness of the developed numerical models. Accompanying website (www.wiley.com/go/ostachowicz) contains demonstration versions of commercial software developed by the authors for modelling and analyzing elastic wave propagation using the Spectral Finite Element Method. Guided Waves in Structures for SHM provides a state of the art resource for researchers and graduate students in structural health monitoring, signal processing and structural dynamics. This book should also provide a useful reference for practising engineers within structural health monitoring and non-destructive testing. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The design of an electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) array device for the inspection of large areas of metallic plate-like structures using the S0 guided wave mode is described. The reasons for using the S0 mode are discussed and it is shown how the choice of mode determines the nature of the EMAT array elements. A novel array construction technique is shown to be necessary whereby the EMAT coils for adjacent elements are overlapped in order to achieve the required element density. Results are presented that illustrate the operation of the device on steel and aluminum plate specimens in the thickness range from 5 to 10 mm. An area of at least 10 m2 can be inspected from a single location. Spurious signals in the results are caused both by the unwanted A0 mode and by S0 sidelobes, the latter occurring at the same radial distance from the array as the genuine S0 signal from a reflector, but in the wrong direction. The signal-to-coherent noise performance of the complete system is determined by the amplitude ratio of the largest genuine S0 signal to the largest spurious signal. This is typically around 30 dB. The sensitivity of the device to artificial defects and genuine corrosion patches is demonstrated and the limitations of its operation are discussed. The feasibility of using the device with the S1 guided wave mode to inspect a 20 mm thick plate is also demonstrated.},

B 91, 104307], has shown how the slow velocity branch depends, amongst other parameters, on the height of the rods that make up the cluster. Such metamaterial, offering easy-to-tune spatial velocity gradients, is a perfect candidate for building gradient index lenses such as Luneburg, Maxwell, and 90? rotating. Here theoretical results are combined with numerical simulations to design and test metalenses for flexural waves. The lenses are obtained by tuning the height of the cluster of rods such that they provide the required refractive index profile.

For this purpose, a plethora of complex architectures (including multiphase materials) and multiphysics approaches have been proposed in the past, often involving difficulties in their practical realization. To address the issue of proposing a material design that enables large band gaps using a simple configuration, in this study we propose an easy-to-manufacture design able to open large, low-frequency complete Lamb band gaps exploiting a suitable arrangement of masses and stiffnesses produced by cavities in a monolithic material. The performance of the designed structure is evaluated by numerical simulations and confirmed by scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (SLDV) measurements on an isotropic polyvinyl chloride plate in which a square ring region of cross-like cavities is fabricated. The full wave field reconstruction clearly confirms the ability of even a limited number of unit cell rows of the proposed design to efficiently attenuate Lamb waves. In addition, numerical simulations show that the structure allows to shift the central frequency of the BG through geometrical modifications. The design may be of interest for applications in which large BGs at low frequencies are required},
