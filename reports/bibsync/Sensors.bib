abstract = {A spatially distributed array of single element piezoelectric transducers is considered for monitoring the integrity of plate-like structures over large areas. When these permanently attached transducers are driven with an impulsive excitation, broadband Lamb waves are generated and received signals are complex, typically containing multiple modes as well as many boundary reflections. The complexity of the signals, including dispersive effects, can be reduced by digital bandpass filtering, and changes in these filtered signals over time can be monitored to detect and localize damage. Results are reported here from an experimental study whereby artificial damage was introduced in an aluminum plate in the form of through holes drilled at various locations. Time shift averaging algorithms were applied to differential signals filtered at multiple frequencies, resulting in many images for the same structural state, and these images were fused to improve damage localization and background noise. Individual and fused images were analyzed to quantify their ability to localize damage. The results show the efficacy of the imaging method as well as the significant improvement resulting from image fusion. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a technique for the analysis of full wavefield data in the wavenumber/frequency domain as an effective tool for damage detection, visualization and characterization. Full wavefield data contain a wealth of information regarding the space and time variation of propagating waves in damaged structural components. Such information can be used to evaluate the response spectrum in the frequency/wavenumber domain, which effectively separates incident waves from reflections caused by discontinuities encountered along the wave paths. This allows removing the injected wave from the overall response through simple filtering strategies, thus highlighting the presence of reflections associated to damage. The concept is first illustrated on analytical and numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are conveniently obtained using a Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer, which allows the detection of displacements and/or velocities over a user- defined grid, and it is able to provide the required spatial and time information in a timely manner. Tests performed on a simple aluminum plate with artificially seeded slits simulating longitudinal cracks, and on a disbonded tongue and grove joint show the effectiveness of the technique and its potential for application to the inspection of a variety of structural components.},

abstract = {The propagation of Lamb waves in elastic plates is analyzed both numerically and experimentally. A Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer (SLDV) is here used to detect and visualize transient waveforms propagating in an elastic plate at low ultrasonic frequencies. The waves are excited by a piezoelectric crystal glued to the plate surface and actuated by sinusoidal pulses of varying frequency. The pulse sequence is triggered by the SLDV internal controller so that phase and delay information are preserved. Such information allows visualization of the waveform pattern as it propagates over the plate surface. The experiment produces animated displacement maps where the interaction with discontinuities in the plate such as defects becomes apparent. This capability suggests application of the SLDV technique as part of an overall damage detection methodology which combines the recognized sensitivity of ultrasonic waves with the localization of damage via wavefield visualization. The interpretation of the experimental results is aided by numerical simulations of ultrasonic waves in plate structures. The simulations are performed using a Local Interaction Simulation Approach (LISA), which represents a simple and effective tool for simulating and visualizing waveforms in isotropic or orthotropic plate-like structures.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Both the aerospace and marine industry have widely relied on a honeycomb sandwich structure (HSS) because of its high strength-to-weight ratio. However, the intrinsic nature of an adhesively bonded multi-layer structure increases the risk of debonding when the structure is under strain or exposed to varying temperatures. Such defects are normally concealed under the surface but can significantly compromise the strength and stiffness of a structure. In this paper, the guided wave method is used to detect debondings which are located between the skin and the honeycomb in sandwich plates. The propagation of guided waves in honeycomb plates is investigated via numerical techniques, with emphasis placed on demonstrating the behavior of structure-based wave interactions (SWIs). The SWI technique is effective to distinguish heterogeneous structures from homogeneous structures. The excitation frequency is necessary to generate obvious SWIs in HSSs; accordingly, a novel strategy is proposed to select the optimal excitation frequencies. A series of experiments are conducted, the results of which show that the presented procedure can be used to effectively detect the locations and the sizes of single-and multi-damage zones in HSSs.},

This research concentrated on diagnostics using attached piezoelectric transducers that excite guided elastic waves. Non-contact method of measurement was used. The laser vibrometer was utilized to measure the velocities of out of plane vibrations related to propagating elastic waves. Excited waves propagate and reflect from the discontinuities encountered on their way, therefore registering them one can obtain information about the structural health of the structure. Several sensor arrangements (networks) were investigated. The focus of the research was on possible area of application and limitations of the investigated networks. Presented research was based on laboratory experiments on prepared specimens. Signals gathered in the discrete network nodes were processed in order to obtain diagnostics information for the whole surface monitored. The voltage signals in the time domain were transferred into spatial domain to indicate the damage position.

abstract = {This paper presents an experimental and theoretical investigation of the applicability of the time-reversal concept to guided waves in plate-like structures, where the stress waves are dispersive and of multi-modes. It is shownthat temporal and spatial focusing can be achieved through time reversal,although the dispersive behaviour of the flexural waves renders it impossible to exactly reconstruct the waveform of the original excitation. Based on the principle of the time-reversal concept, a digital imaging method suitable for distributed sensor/actuator networks has been developed. This new method, which overcomes the limitation of the conventional phased array method that operates under pulse-echo mode, provides an efficient imaging method for locating and approximate sizing of structural damages. In addition, it has been shown that signal strengths can be considerably enhanced by applying the present synthetic time-reversal method, thus reducing the number of sensors and actuators required to achieve a given signal-to-noise ratio.},

The elastic wave propagation phenomenon was used for damage localization in thin aluminium panels. This approach utilized the fact that any discontinuities existing in structural elements cause local changes of physical material properties which affect elastic wave propagation. Elastic waves were excited and received using piezoelectric transducer networks with different element arrangements. The method of transducer placement and the number of piezoelectric elements used had an influence on the accuracy of the damage localization algorithm. Obviously, the more elements there were, the more data had to be processed. After the acquisition process signal processing was conducted in order to create damage influence maps. These maps presents elastic wave energy connected with reflection from discontinuities. In order to create such a map a computer program was developed that assigns a mesh of points to the panel surface. At each point the energy of elastic wave reflection was calculated. This energy was extracted from the acquired signals. This paper summarizes an extensive experimental investigation that included three damage scenarios and twelve transducer configurations.},

abstract = {In this work a problem of damage detection and localization was investigated. A new configuration of piezoelectric transducers was proposed. It consists of twelve transducers. It is in a form of an equilateral triangle that has a 2Ã—2 transducer array in each vertex. Transducers of this configuration were used to excite and register guided waves in an aluminum alloy specimen. Due to known sensitivity of these waves to structural defects it was assumed that registered waves, in the form of voltage signals, carry information about the structure condition. A special algorithm was implemented to process these signals and extract features related to damage. This algorithm transfers information from the time domain to the spatial domain. Results are mapped into coordinate system assigned to monitored structure. In this way in the case of damage present outside or inside the configuration its coordinates are highlighted. In order to detect damage on the direct path between triangle vertices a damage index is defined that indicates whether there is damage present or not. Experimental investigation included three scenarios, one for outside and one for inside localization and one for direct path detection. Results showed that this method has a potential for Structural Health Monitoring of a structure made of an isotropic material. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper presents an experimental and a simulation study of baseline-free damage detection in a stiffened aluminum plate by time reversed Lamb wave (TRLW). In this study, single Lamb wave mode (A0) is generated and sensed using piezoelectric (PZT) transducers through specific transducer placement and amplitude tuning. Different stiffening configurations such as plane and T-stiffeners are considered. Damage cases of disbonding of stiffeners from the base plate, and vertical and embedded cracks in the stiffened plate, are studied.

abstract = {For many decades, ultrasonic imaging inspection has been adopted as a principal method to detect multiple defects, e.g., void and corrosion. However, the data interpretation relies on an inspector's subjective judgment, thus making the results vulnerable to human error. Nowadays, advanced computer vision techniques reveal new perspectives on the high-level visual understanding of universal tasks. This research aims to develop an efficient automatic ultrasonic image analysis system for nondestructive testing (NDT) using the latest visual information processing technique. To this end, we first established an ultrasonic inspection image dataset containing 6849 ultrasonic scan images with full defect/no-defect annotations. Using the dataset, we performed a comprehensive experimental comparison of various computer vision techniques, including both conventional methods using hand-crafted visual features and the most recent convolutional neural networks (CNN) which generate multiple-layer stacking for representation learning. In the computer vision community, the two groups are referred to as shallow and deep learning, respectively. Experimental results make it clear that the deep learning-enabled system outperformed conventional (shallow) learning schemes by a large margin. We believe this benchmarking could be used as a reference for similar research dealing with automatic defect detection in ultrasonic imaging inspection.},

abstract = {This study proposes a complete noncontact laser ultrasonic wavefield imaging technique to automatically detect and visualize hidden delamination and debonding in composite structures. First, ultrasonic wavefield is obtained from a target structure by scanning a Nd:YAG pulse laser beam for ultrasonic wave generation and measuring the corresponding ultrasonic responses using a laser Doppler vibrometer. Then, hidden damages are identified and visualized through adoption of a standing wave filter, which can isolate damage-induced standing waves from the obtained wavefield. The proposed technique has following advantages over the existing techniques: (1) it does not require any sensor installation; (2) it is noninvasive, rapidly deployable and applicable to harsh environments; and (3) it can visualize damage with high spatial resolution without any baseline data, which enables automated and intuitive damage diagnosis. The feasibility of the proposed technique is demonstrated by visualizing a debonding in a carbon fiber reinforced plastic aircraft wing and a delamination in a glass fiber reinforced plastic wind turbine blade. Furthermore, the effects of temperature and static loading variations on the proposed technique are also examined. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents certain results of an experimental study related with a damage detection in structural elements based on deviations in guided elastic wave propagation patterns. In order to excite guided elastic waves within specimens tested piezoelectric transducers have been applied. As excitation signals 5 sine cycles modulated by Hanning window have been used. Propagation of guided elastic waves has been monitored by a scanning Doppler laser vibrometer. The time signals recorded during measurement have been utilised to calculate the values of RMS. It has turned out that the values of RMS differed significantly in damaged areas from the values calculated for the healthy ones. In this way it has become possible to pinpoint precisely the locations of damage over the entire measured surface. All experimental investigations have been carried out for thin aluminium or composite plates. Damage has been simulated by a small additional mass attached on the plate surface or by a narrow notch cut. It has been shown that proposed method allows one to localise damage of various shapes and sizes within structural elements over the whole area under investigation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Rao2017,
abstract = {Corrosion is a major safety and economic concern to various industries. In this paper, a novel ultrasonic guided wave tomography (GWT) system based on self-designed piezoelectric sensors is presented for on-line corrosion monitoring of large plate-like structures. Accurate thickness reconstruction of corrosion damages is achieved by using the dispersive regimes of selected guided waves and a reconstruction algorithm based on full waveform inversion (FWI). The system makes use of an array of miniaturised piezoelectric transducers that are capable of exciting and receiving highly dispersive A0 Lamb wave mode at low frequencies. The scattering from transducer array has been found to have a small effect on the thickness reconstruction. The efficiency and the accuracy of the new system have been demonstrated through continuous forced corrosion experiments. The FWI reconstructed thicknesses show good agreement with analytical predictions obtained by Faraday's law and laser measurements, and more importantly, the thickness images closely resemble the actual corrosion sites.},
