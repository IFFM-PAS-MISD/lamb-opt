abstract = {Cost-effective and reliable damage detection is critical for the utilization of composite materials. This paper presents part of an experimental and analytical survey of candidate methods for in situ damage detection of composite materials. Experimental results are presented for the application of Lamb wave techniques to quasi-isotropic graphite/epoxy test specimens containing representative damage modes, including delamination, transverse ply cracks and through-holes. Linear wave scans were performed on narrow laminated specimens and sandwich beams with various cores by monitoring the transmitted waves with piezoceramic sensors. Optimal actuator and sensor configurations were devised through experimentation, and various types of driving signal were explored. These experiments provided a procedure capable of easily and accurately determining the time of flight of a Lamb wave pulse between an actuator and sensor. Lamb wave techniques provide more information about damage presence and severity than previously tested methods (frequency response techniques), and provide the possibility of determining damage location due to their local response nature. These methods may prove suitable for structural health monitoring applications since they travel long distances and can be applied with conformable piezoelectric actuators and sensors that require little power.},

@article{Kiranyaz2019e,
abstract = {During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application-specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and motor-fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publically shared in a dedicated website.},

@article{Lemistre2001a,
abstract = {A health monitoring system is presented composed of integrated disc-shaped, 100 $\mu$m thick and 5 mm diameter piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) working sequentially as Lamb wave emitters and receivers. The diagnostic is based on the analysis of Lamb wave signals recorded before and after damage. In the composite, delaminations are discontinuities producing mode conversion processes generating various outgoing modes. The multiresolution processing allows the isolation of various propagation modes and their extraction in order to measure, for various propagation paths, the time delay between the arrivals of the main burst and of a specific outgoing mode. This process permits, with good accuracy, the localization of damage and the estimation of its extent. The robustness and portability of this technique is demonstrated by the fact that, after validation in our laboratory, it was successfully applied to data coming from an experiment conducted in another laboratory using its own acousto-ultrasonic health monitoring hardware system.},

@article{Cha2017b,
abstract = {A number of image processing techniques (IPTs) have been implemented for detecting civil infrastructure defects to partially replace human-conducted onsite inspections. These IPTs are primarily used to manipulate images to extract defect features, such as cracks in concrete and steel surfaces. However, the extensively varying real-world situations (e.g., lighting and shadow changes) can lead to challenges to the wide adoption of IPTs. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a vision-based method using a deep architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting concrete cracks without calculating the defect features. As CNNs are capable of learning image features automatically, the proposed method works without the conjugation of IPTs for extracting features. The designed CNN is trained on 40 K images of 256 × 256 pixel resolutions and, consequently, records with about 98{\%} accuracy. The trained CNN is combined with a sliding window technique to scan any image size larger than 256 × 256 pixel resolutions. The robustness and adaptability of the proposed approach are tested on 55 images of 5,888 × 3,584 pixel resolutions taken from a different structure which is not used for training and validation processes under various conditions (e.g., strong light spot, shadows, and very thin cracks). Comparative studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed CNN using traditional Canny and Sobel edge detection methods. The results show that the proposed method shows quite better performances and can indeed find concrete cracks in realistic situations.},

@article{Khan2018a,
abstract = {Given the advancements in modern technological capabilities, having an integrated health management and diagnostic strategy becomes an important part of a system's operational life-cycle. This is because it can be used to detect anomalies, analyse failures and predict the future state based on up-to-date information. By utilising condition data and on-site feedback, data models can be trained using machine learning and statistical concepts. Once trained, the logic for data processing can be embedded on on-board controllers whilst enabling real-time health assessment and analysis. However, this integration inevitably faces several difficulties and challenges for the community; indicating the need for novel approaches to address this vexing issue. Deep learning has gained increasing attention due to its potential advantages with data classification and feature extraction problems. It is an evolving research area with diverse application domains and hence its use for system health management applications must been researched if it can be used to increase overall system resilience or potential cost benefits for maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities. This article presents a systematic review of artificial intelligence based system health management with an emphasis on recent trends of deep learning within the field. Various architectures and related theories are discussed to clarify its potential. Based on the reviewed work, deep learning demonstrates plausible benefits for fault diagnosis and prognostics. However, there are a number of limitations that hinder its widespread adoption and require further development. Attention is paid to overcoming these challenges, with future opportunities being enumerated.},

@article{Michaels2008a,
abstract = {Permanently attached piezoelectric sensors arranged in a spatially distributed array are under consideration for structural health monitoring systems incorporating active ultrasonic methods. Most damage detection and localization methods that have been proposed are based upon comparing monitored signals to baselines recorded from the structure prior to initiation of damage. To be effective, this comparison process must take into account any conditions other than damage that have changed the ultrasonic signals. Proposed here is a two-step process whereby damage is first detected and is then localized and characterized. The detection strategy considers the long time behavior of the signals in the diffuse-like regime where distinct echoes can no longer be identified. The localization strategy is to generate images of damage based upon the early time regime when discrete echoes from boundary reflections and scattering sites are meaningful. Results are shown for an aluminum plate with artificial damage introduced in combination with temperature variations. The loss of local temporal coherence combined with an optimal baseline selection procedure is shown to be effective for the detection of damage, and a delay-and-sum imaging method applied to the residual signals both localizes the damage and provides characterization information. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The health monitoring of aerostructures assists performance enhancement of existing structures. Continuous monitoring and different techniques involved in the structural monitoring help to increase the efficiency of structures, postpone the failures, and provide the prototype for future aerospace structures with better durability. Structural performance of aerospace composites depends on strength, stiffness, yield capacity, bending capacity, resistance against corrosion, impact and lightning, and fatigue due to cyclic loading. In structural monitoring, the four different stages followed to monitor any damage in aerospace composite structure are operation evaluation, data accession, feature extraction, followed by statistical modeling. This chapter on structural health monitoring for aerostructures elaborates the methods to detect and prevent the failures in the structures, as observed through a series of literature available based on the type of damages and techniques to detect them like cracking, fiber pullout, delamination and shearography, eddy current method, transient thermographic method, etc, respectively. In this chapter structural health monitoring of composite aerostructures is reviewed in detail. Different techniques used to monitor the various failures occurring in the composite structures in aerospace industry are explained in detail. Structures made of composite material used in aerospace fail due to fiber-matrix damage. Hence, it is important to analyze such damage like fiber buckling, fiber splitting, fiber cracking, fiber fracture, and fiber bending, and cracks in the matrix etc. to prevent catastrophic results.},

@article{Gopalakrishnan2018a,
abstract = {The field of computer vision based civil infrastructure defect detection is constantly evolving with steady advances being made in sensing technologies, hardware, and image processing techniques. Although a number of image processing techniques have been proposed over the years with varying degrees of success, real-world situations (e.g., lack of background illumination, shadow changes) pose a significant challenge to the wide adoption of such techniques, especially for routine analysis. With the emerging application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones for civil infrastructure inspection and condition monitoring, an added level of complexity is introduced in vision-based crack detection as the process of acquiring images using UAVs is not yet standardized resulting in images of widely varying sizes, resolutions, blurriness, etc. In recent years, Deep Learning, a generalized form of Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms that can learn very complex mappings between inputs and outputs directly from the data, has achieved huge success in diverse fields such as automatic speech recognition, image recognition, Natural Language Processing (NLP), drug and materials discovery, etc. However, the large number of hidden neurons and layers used in DNNs result in computationally-intensive matrix and vector computations involving millions of parameters, requiring the use of high-performance computing systems. Also, it is practically impossible to get labeled “big data” samples in many domains to be able to train an entire DNN from scratch. In such situations, the use of a pre-trained deep learning model and fine-tuning it to the novel task at hand with smaller datasets, has shown to be successful across domains. In this paper, we propose the use of pre-trained deep learning models with transfer learning for crack damage detection in UAV images of civil infrastructure. The robustness of the proposed approach is tested on a small set of real-world, complex UAV-sourced infrastructure images not used during training and validation. The results show that the proposed method can rapidly and easily achieve up to 90{\%} accuracy in finding cracks in realistic situations without any augmentation and preprocessing.},
