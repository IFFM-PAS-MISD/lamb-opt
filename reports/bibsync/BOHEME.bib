abstract = {Acoustic filters and metamaterials have become essential components for elastic wave control in applications ranging from ultrasonics to noise abatement. Other devices have been designed in this field, emulating their electromagnetic counterparts. One such case is an acoustic diode or rectifier, which enables one-way wave transmission by breaking the wave equation-related reciprocity. Its achievement, however, has proved to be rather problematic, and current realizations display a number of shortcomings in terms of simplicity and versatility. Here, we present the design, fabrication and characterization of a device able to work as an acoustic diode, a switch and a transistor-like apparatus, exploiting symmetry-breaking nonlinear effects like harmonic generation and wave mixing, and the filtering capabilities of metamaterials. This device presents several advantages compared with previous acoustic diode realizations, including versatility, time invariance, frequency preserving characteristics and switchability. We numerically evaluate its efficiency and demonstrate its feasibility in a preliminary experimental realization. This work may provide new opportunities for the practical realization of structural components with one-way wave propagation properties.},

abstract = {Second harmonic generation is one of the most sensitive and reliable nonlinear elastic signatures for micro-damage assessment. However, its detection requires powerful amplification systems generating fictitious harmonics that are difficult to discern from pure nonlinear elastic effects. Current state-of-the-art nonlinear ultrasonic methods still involve impractical solutions such as cumbersome signal calibration processes and substantial modifications of the test component in order to create material-based tunable harmonic filters. Here we propose and demonstrate a valid and sensible alternative strategy involving the development of an ultrasonic phononic crystal waveguide transducer that exhibits both single and multiple frequency stop-bands filtering out fictitious second harmonic frequencies. Remarkably, such a sensing device can be easily fabricated and integrated on the surface of the test structure without altering its mechanical and geometrical properties. The design of the phononic crystal structure is supported by a perturbative theoretical model predicting the frequency band-gaps of periodic plates with sinusoidal corrugation. We find our theoretical findings in excellent agreement with experimental testing revealing that the proposed phononic crystal waveguide transducer successfully attenuates second harmonics caused by the ultrasonic equipment, thus demonstrating its wide range of potential applications for acousto/ultrasonic material damage inspection.},

abstract = {Metamaterials are composed of arrays of subwavelength-sized artificial structures; these architectures give rise to novel characteristics that can be exploited to manipulate electromagnetic waves and acoustic waves. They have been also used to manipulate elastic waves, but such waves have a coupling property, so metamaterials for elastic waves uses a different method than for electromagnetic and acoustic waves. Since researches on this type of metamaterials is sparse, this paper reviews studies that used elastic materials to manipulate elastic waves, and introduces applications using extraordinary characteristics induced by metamaterials. Bragg scattering and local resonances have been exploited to introduce a locally resonant elastic metamaterial, a gradient-index lens, a hyperlens, and elastic cloaking. The principles and applications of metasurfaces that can overcome the disadvantages of bulky elastic metamaterials are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents a nonlinear elastic material model able to simulate the nonlinear effects generated by the interaction of acoustic/ultrasonic waves with damage precursors and micro-cracks in a variety of materials. Such a constitutive model is implemented in an in-house finite element code and exhibits a multiscale nature where the macroscopic behavior of damaged structures can be represented through a contribution of a number of mesoscopic elements, which are composed by a statistical collection of microscopic units. By means of the semi-analytical Landau formulation and Preisach-Mayergoyz space representation, this multiscale model allows the description of the structural response under continuous harmonic excitation of micro-damaged materials showing both anharmonic and dissipative hysteretic effects. In this manner, nonlinear effects observed experimentally, such as the generation of both even and odd harmonics, can be reproduced. In addition, by using Kelvin eigentensors and eigenelastic constants, the wave propagation problem in both isotropic and orthotropic solids was extended to the three-dimensional Cartesian space. The developed model has been verified for a number of different geometrical and material configurations. Particularly, the influence of a small region with classical and non-classical elasticity and the variations of the input amplitudes on the harmonics generation were analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Acoustical Society of America.},

First, a parametric analysis is carried out to find plate thickness and cross-like holes dimensions capable to nucleate complete band gaps. In this analysis the band structures of the unitary cell in the first Brillouin zone are computed by exploiting the Bloch-Floquet theorem. Next, time transient finite element analyses are performed to highlight the shielding effect of a finite dimension phononic region, formed by unitary cells arranged into four concentric square rings, on the propagation of guided waves. Finally, ultrasonic experimental tests in pitch-catch configuration across the phononic region, machined on a PVC plate, are executed and analyzed. Very good agreement between numerical and experimental results are found confirming the existence of the predicted band gaps.},

abstract = {This article presents a parallel algorithm to model the nonlinear dynamic interactions between ultrasonic guided waves and fatigue cracks. The Local Interaction Simulation Approach (LISA) is further developed to capture the contact-impact clapping phenomena during the wave crack interactions based on the penalty method. Initial opening and closure distributions are considered to approximate the 3-D rough crack microscopic features. A Coulomb friction model is integrated to capture the stick-slip contact motions between the crack surfaces. The LISA procedure is parallelized via the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), which enables parallel computing on powerful graphic cards. The explicit contact formulation, the parallel algorithm, as well as the GPU-based implementation facilitate LISA's high computational efficiency over the conventional finite element method (FEM). This article starts with the theoretical formulation and numerical implementation of the proposed algorithm, followed by the solution behavior study and numerical verification against a commercial finite element code. Numerical case studies are conducted on Lamb wave interactions with fatigue cracks. Several nonlinear ultrasonic phenomena are addressed. The classical nonlinear higher harmonic and DC response are successfully captured. The nonlinear mode conversion at a through-thickness and a half-thickness fatigue crack is investigated. Threshold behaviors, induced by initial openings and closures of rough crack surfaces, are depicted by the proposed contact LISA model.},

abstract = {As a rule, problems of wave propagation in finite media with non-uniform spatial distribution of material properties can only be tackled by numerical models. In addition, the modeling of damage features in a material requires the introduction of locally non-linear and - more important - non-unique equations of state. Using a multiscale approach, we have implemented a non-linear hysteretic stress-strain relation based on the Preisach-Mayergoyz (PM) model, into a numerical elastodynamic finite integration technique program, which has originally been developed for linearly elastic wave propagation in inhomogeneous media. The simulation results show qualitatively good agreement with data of non-linear resonant bar experiments in homogeneously non-linear and hysteretic media. When the PM density distribution of hysteretic units at the mesoscopic level is not uniform and/or confined to a finite area in stress-stress space, the response at high amplitude excitation tend to deviate from the quasi-analytical results obtained in the case of a uniform PM-space density. Localized microdamage features in an intact medium can be modeled by conceiving finite zones with pronounced hysteretic stress-strain relations within a "linear" surrounding. Forward calculations reveal a significant influence of the amplitude dependent resonance behavior on the location (edge versus center of a bar), the extend (width of the zone) and the degree (density of hysteretic units) of damage. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Detection and characterization of delamination damage are of great importance to the assurance of structural safety. This work investigates the potential of a baseline-free structural health monitoring technique based on higher harmonics resulting from the nonlinear interaction of guided wave and a delamination. The nonlinearity considered in this study arises from the clapping of the sub-laminates in the delaminated region, which generates contact acoustic nonlinearity. Both explicit finite element simulations and experimental tests are conducted on composite laminates containing a delamination of different sizes and at different through-thickness locations. The results show that the interaction between the fundamental asymmetric mode (A0) of guided wave and a delamination generates contact acoustic nonlinearity in the form of higher harmonics, which provides a good measure for identifying the existence of delaminations and determining their sizes in laminated composite beams. This new insight into the generation mechanisms of nonlinear higher order harmonics in composite laminates will enhance the detection and monitoring of damage in composite structures.},

Second, a study is conducted on the interaction of a Rayleigh wave with a microdamaged zone with hysteretic nonlinearity at the surface of an otherwise linear body, and the influence of the microdamaged zone on the surface wave velocity and on the generation of harmonics is examined. It is found that the effect of hysteresis on the Rayleigh wave propagation can be barely seen in the surface wave velocity measurement, but shows up nicely in the wave spectrum.

abstract = {Lamb waves exhibit conical dispersion at zero wave number when an accidental degeneracy occurs between thickness mode longitudinal and shear resonances of the same symmetry. Here we investigate the propagation of Lamb waves generated at the conical point frequency and the interaction of these waves with defects and interfaces. the group velocity and mode shapes of Lamb waves at the conical point are found, and it is shown that as the wavenumber gets close to zero, considerable group velocity is seen only for material properties supporting a degeneracy or near-degeneracy. the unusual wave propagation and mode conversion of Lamb waves generated at the conical point are elucidated through numerical simulations. experimental measurements of near conical point Lamb wave interaction with holes in a plate demonstrate that these waves flow around defects while maintaining a constant phase of oscillation across that plate surface. Lamb waves are guided waves that propagate through plates and are the result of reflection, refraction, and mode conversion of bulk waves from the plate surfaces. The theory of Lamb wave propagation is well established and Lamb waves have been used for a multitude of applications including nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of plates, structural health monitoring, and sensing systems 1-3. Lamb waves follow a complex dispersion relation described by the Rayleigh-Lamb equation, and the specific shape of the dispersion curves in a homogeneous, isotropic plate is dictated by the Poisson's ratio 4. For a given application, it is often advantageous to access specific Lamb wave modes with favorable propagation characteristics. For long-range inspection applications, for instance, Lamb waves with small group velocity dispersion are used in order to minimize wave packet spreading with propagation distance. For local measurements, one can excite Lamb waves at particular points on the dispersion curve where the group velocity goes to zero while the phase velocity remains finite. At such zero group velocity (ZGV) points, a strong and localized resonance can be excited and used, for example, to determine elastic properties, monitor adhesion, or track fatigue damage 5-16. ZGV points are common to both acoustic and optical waveguides and are the result of a repulsion between two modes near a wave vector (k) of zero that leads to backward wave propagation, or a wave propagation with counter-directed phase and group velocities, in one of the modes 17,18. The ZGV point is located at the transition between backward and forward wave propagation. The repulsion between modes is the strongest when an accidental degeneracy occurs 19. In the case of Lamb waves, this means that there is a coincidence between the frequencies of longitudinal and shear resonances of the same symmetry 20. A salient feature associated with accidental degeneracy is that the dispersion curve passes linearly through k = 0, allowing for a peculiar type of wave which propagates with an infinite wavelength but retains a finite group velocity. This wave propagates away from a source without a phase advance, producing a temporal oscillation of the plate that is uniform across the surface. Such behavior, evident in homogeneous elastic and optical waveguides, has also seen widespread attention in acoustic and optical "zero index" or "near zero index" metamaterials where linear dispersion, or conical dispersion in a three-dimensional sense, is achieved through a combination of materials structure and induced degeneracy 21-27. Recently, it was recognized and experimentally demonstrated that a simple, homogenous, aluminum plate shows linear dispersion through k = 0 at a particular Poisson's ratio where accidental degeneracy occurs 28,29. Degeneracy was induced by adjusting the elastic properties of the plate over a small range through temperature change. It was also shown that waves excited in a plate near k = 0, referred to as conical point waves, exhibited open 2 Scientific RepoRtS | (2019) 9:15216 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51187-9 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ angle independent mode conversion upon encountering a plate edge. Here, we derive the group velocity of conical point Lamb waves through implicit differentiation of the Rayleigh-Lamb equations, and provide the mode shapes as k approaches zero. We track the group velocity of modes at low k values and show that long wavelength Lamb waves can propagate with non-negligible group velocity only if the mechanical properties are such that degen-eracy or near-degeneracy on a given mode occurs. We provide a computational and experimental study of near conical point Lamb wave interaction with holes and other discontinuities in a plate and find that the near conical point waves flow around defects while maintaining a constant phase of oscillation across that plate surface. Mode conversion at a hole interface is nearly spatially isotropic, regardless of the position of the excitation source. We propose that conical point and near-conical point Lamb waves provide a facile means of investigating the physics of "zero index" wave propagation. In addition, for specific materials that exhibit near-degeneracy of modes with like symmetry, they could find application in the nondestructive characterization of elastic waveguides.

A possible answer to this problem is offered by newly developed nonlinear ultrasonic techniques, which monitors the nonlinear elastic wave propagation behaviour introduced by damage, to detect its presence and location. In this paper, a new nonlinear time reversal technique is presented for the detection and localization of a scattered zone (damage) in a multi-material medium. In particular, numerical findings on a friction stir-welded aluminium plate-like structure are reported. Damage was introduced in the heat affected zone and modelled using a multi-scale material constitutive model (Preisach-Mayergoyz space). Studies were conducted for two different transducer configurations. Particular attention was devoted to find the optimum time-reversed window to be re-emitted in the structures. The methodology was compared with traditional time-reversal acoustics (TRA), showing significant improvements. While the traditional TRA was not able to clearly localise the damage, the developed technique identified in a clear manner the faulted zone, showing its robustness to locate and characterize nonlinear sources, in presence of a multi-material medium. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the Preisach model a ferromagnetic structure is divided into magnetic domains, each switching between two different states. The hysteresis for a single domain is a rectangular-shaped hysteresis loop with an upper switching point $\alpha$ and a lower switching point $\beta$. The hysteresis of the whole ferromagnet is the superposition of all loops involved. The Preisach model comprises a weighting function $\mu$($\alpha$,$\beta$) for every pair ($\alpha$,$\beta$) that needs to be determined for every hysteresis curve from experimental data a priori. From a physicist's point of view the Preisach model could be employed for studying ensembles of ferromagnetic particles. The model can serve as a link between theory and experiment in order to describe a microscopical system by a macroscopical measurement. From an engineer's point of view a mathematical model for hysteresis could serve as a compact description of a ferromagnetic device in an electrical circuit. The case study presented here shows how the weighting function $\mu$($\alpha$,$\beta$) is determined for given values of ($\alpha$,$\beta$).
