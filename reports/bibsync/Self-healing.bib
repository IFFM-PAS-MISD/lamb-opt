abstract = {This article investigates the role of ambient temperature in causing changes to the structural wave propagation, as sensed by piezoelectric transducers, in a newer perspective. A novel approach is proposed to compensate the influence of tem-perature on piezo-sensor response using both analytical models and numerical simulations. Parametric studies using numerical simulations for plates with surface-mounted piezoelectric transducers establish linear functional relationship between change in sensor signals and specific combination of material properties, within certain temperature range. A numerical temperature compensation model is developed based on this functional relationship to reconstruct piezo-sensor signals at elevated temperatures. Matching pursuitâ€“based signal analysis and reconstruction schemes are used in this study. Practical efficacy of the compensation model is tested for metallic structures with both simple and complex geometries. Model-based reconstruction of first wave packets in the sensor signals is found to match quite well with the experimental measurements. Performance of the proposed compensation model is also found to be at par with the existing state-of-art temperature compensation methods. A very limited set of baseline sensor data is required to esti-mate unknown model parameters, making this approach to be efficient and practically useful. The output of the compen-sation model is also used to obtain an accurate estimate of damage location in a structure under varying ambient temperature environments.},

@article{ElKadi2017,
abstract = {Textile reinforce cements (TRC) are innovative materials that are used for repair of existing structures or recently as stand-alone lightweight structural members. Fracture and thermal behavior of these materials are very complicated due to multiple failure modes. The undergoing processes cannot be described by the simple constitutive equation. In this perspective the contribution of monitoring techniques is crucial. Acoustic emission (AE) is used to check the behavior of TRC beams and plates in different states of structural health: intact, thermally pre-cracked and self-healed by polymer powder. This is the first time that the AE behaviors of intact, cracked and self-healed TRC laminates are compared in literature.},

@article{Kudela2015a,
abstract = {This research is related to a signal processing of full wavefield data as an effective tool for detection, localization and visualization of a crack growth in thin-walled structures. Full wavefield data of propagating Lamb waves in structures such as plates and shells made out of metallic alloys and composite laminates contain a wealth of information about wave pattern anomalies due to occurrence of a damage. The aim is to demonstrate a method for enhancing damage visualization in structures such that estimation of the length and orientation of the crack can be easily obtained. The proposed signal processing involves application of discrete fast Fourier transform, wavenumber domain filtering and inverse discrete Fourier transform. The method is further enhanced by a technique for compensation of the wave attenuation so that the effects of structural damage have the same influence regardless of the location. The concept is first illustrated on numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, which allows the measurement of displacements and/or velocities along three axes over a user-defined grid. In the proposed method only out-of-plane velocities are used. Tests performed on simple aluminum and composite plates with artificially introduced longitudinal cracks confirm the effectiveness of the method and its potential for application to the inspection of a variety of structural components. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
