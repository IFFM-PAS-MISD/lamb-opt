abstract = {A fully non-contact laser-based nondestructive inspection (NDI) system is developed to detect and visualize damage in structures. The study focuses on the size quantification and characterization of a barely visible impact damage (BVID) in a honeycomb composite panel. The hardware consists of a Q-switched Nd:YAG pulse laser that probes the panel by generating broadband guided waves via thermo-elastic expansion. The laser, in combination with a set of galvano-mirrors is used to raster scan over a two-dimensional surface covering the damaged region of an impacted quasi-isotropic [60/0/−60]s honeycomb composite panel. The out-of-plane velocities are measured at a fixed location normal to the surface by a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). An ultrasonic full wavefield assembled from the three-dimensional space-time data matrix in the interrogated area is first acquired and then processed for imaging the impacted damage area. A wavenumber filtering technique in terms of wave vectors is applied to distinguish the forward and backward wavefields in the wavenumber-frequency domain. A zero-lag cross correlation (ZLCC) imaging condition is then employed in the space-frequency domain for damage imaging. The ZLCC imaging condition consists of cross correlating the incident and reflected wavefields in the entire scanned region. The condition not only images the damage boundary between incident and reflected waves outside the damage region but also, for longer time windows, enables to capture the momentary standing waves formed within the damaged region. The ZLCC imaging condition imaged two delaminated region: a main delamination, which was a skewed elliptic with major and minor axis lengths roughly 17 mm and 10 mm respectively, and a secondary delamination region approximately 6 mm by 4 mm, however, which can only be shown at higher frequency range around 80–95 kHz. To conclude, the ZLCC results were in very good agreement with ultrasonic C-scan and X-ray computed tomographic (X-ray CT) scan results. Since the imaging condition is performed in the space-frequency domain, the imaging from ZLCC can also reveal resonance modes which are shown in the main delaminated area by windowing a narrow frequency band sequentially.},

@article{Michaels2009a,
abstract = {Full acoustic wavefield data were acquired from an aluminum plate with various structural discontinuities and artificial defects using an air-coupled transducer mounted on a scanning stage. Piezoelectric transducers permanently mounted on the specimen were used as wave sources. These source transducers were elements of a permanently attached sparse array. A time series of wavefield images clearly shows details of guided waves as they propagate outward from the source, reflect from specimen boundaries, and scatter from discontinuities within the structure. Distinct S0and A0Lamb wave modes are directly visible on constant time snapshots of the captured wavefield. However, the waves propagating outward from the source, and waves reflected from boundaries, obscure the weaker waves that are scattered from defects. To facilitate analysis of weaker scattered waves, source waves are removed from the full wavefield data using both time and frequency domain methods. The effectiveness of each method is evaluated in the wavenumber-wavenumber domain and results are fused to obtain images of scattered wavefields. The method is demonstrated on a through hole, to which a notch is added to simulate a crack. The angular dependence of the scattered wavefield is experimentally determined for source waves incident on the notch from two directions, one toward the side of the notch and the other toward the end of the notch. {\textcopyright} 2009 SPIE.},

abstract = {This paper presents an automated crack visualization technique using ultrasonic wavefield images obtained by a complete noncontact laser scanning system. First, the complete noncontact laser scanning system is built by integrating and synchronizing a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser for ultrasonic generation, a laser Doppler vibrometer for ultrasonic measurement and galvanometers for scanning. Then, four different laser scanning schemes are compared to find the most effective and practical ultrasonic scanning strategy for the presented application. Second, a novel image processing technique is developed to isolate and visualize crack-induced standing wave energy from the constructed ultrasonic propagation images. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed laser ultrasonic scanning system and imaging processing technique is experimentally verified using ultrasonic scanning images obtained from an aluminum plate. The test results confirmed that a hidden notch invisible from the scanned surface was successfully detected and visualized, while no false positive alarm was triggered for an intact specimen. (Some},

@misc{Michaels2011a,
abstract = {Full wavefield measurements obtained with either an air-coupled transducer mounted on a scanning stage or a scanning laser vibrometer can be combined with effective signal and imaging processing algorithms to support characterization of guided waves as well as detection, localization and quantification of structural damage. These wavefield images contain a wealth of information that clearly shows details of guided waves as they propagate outward from the source, reflect from specimen boundaries, and scatter from discontinuities within the structure. The analysis of weaker scattered waves is facilitated by the removal of source waves and the separation of wave modes, which is effectively achieved via frequency-wavenumber domain filtering in conjunction with the subsequent analysis of the resulting residual signals. Incident wave removal highlights the presence and the location of weak scatterers, while the separation of individual guided wave modes allows the characterization of their separate contribution to the scattered field and the evaluation of mode conversion phenomena. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated through their application to detection of a delamination in a composite plate and detection of a crack emanating from a hole. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.
