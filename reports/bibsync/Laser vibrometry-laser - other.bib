abstract = {The research effort in this thesis is devoted to develop techniques to accurately and rapidly identify the location, orientation, and magnitude of the defects by using structural health monitoring concepts that use Laser Doppler Vibrometer as a non-contact sensor with multi-point sensing capability. The first research area addresses the formulation and validation of an innovative Damage Measure that is based on the ratios of the strain energy distributions of the damaged and undamaged structure. The innovations include use of a single set of actuator/sensor pair to excite and detect the responses of a structure for low frequency vibrations as well as guided wave propagation studies. A second new capability is the estimation of the Damage Measure without requiring any knowledge of the undamaged baseline structure. This method is made possible because of the development of these new technologies: Spatial Decimation and Wavenumber/Frequency filtering. The third contribution is to develop analytical models for the structural dynamics of damaged structure and seek solutions that use perturbation methods to detect damage in a plate structure. The fourth contribution is the development of a comprehensive damage detection technique over a wide frequency dynamic range. The fifth topic of research involves automation in Structural Health Monitoring based on the comprehensive Damage Measure formulation. Under the control of software the Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer is used to acquire the low frequency vibration mode data for a coarse identification of all the suspect regions of damage using a threshold criterion on the Damage Measure. Each suspect region of damage is further investigated using the high frequency elastic wave propagation to clearly identify the location, orientation, and extent of the damage. The computer control of the Laser Doppler Vibrometer and a quantitative assessment of the damage provide the enabling technologies for the automation proof of concept. Finally the developed techniques of damage detection are successfully demonstrated on practical structures such as a turbine blade in the laboratory and an F-15 vertical tail in field maintenance conditions.},
