abstract = {Recent studies show that a broad category of materials share "nonclassical" nonlinear elastic behavior much different from "classical" (Landau-type) nonlinearity. Manifestations of "nonclassical" nonlinearity include stress-strain hysteresis and discrete memory in quasistatic experiments, and specific dependencies of the harmonic amplitudes with respect to the drive amplitude in dynamic wave experiments, which are remarkably different from those predicted by the classical theory. These materials have in common soft "bond" elements, where the elastic nonlinearity originates, contained in hard matter (e.g., a rock sample). The bond system normally comprises a small fraction of the total material volume, and can be localized (e.g., a crack in a solid) or distributed, as in a rock. In this paper a model is presented in which the soft elements are treated as hysteretic or reversible elastic units connected in a one-dimensional lattice to elastic elements (grains), which make up the hard matrix. Calculations are performed in the framework of the local interaction simulation approach (LISA). Experimental observations are well predicted by the model, which is now ready both for basic investigations about the physical origins of nonlinear elasticity and for applications to material damage diagnostics.},

abstract = {The spectral element method for the analysis of wave propagation in structures is extended by the introduction of a super-element concept to handle local regions of non-uniformity. The region of interest is meshed with conventional finite elements and its stiffness and mass matrices dynamically condensed leaving only the connection degrees of freedom. These are further condensed to just waveguide connectivities thus making the element suitable for assembly with other spectral elements. The formulation is verified by comparison with 2-D finite element solutions. Examples of its use in waveguides with cracks, holes and extended joints are demonstrated. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {An accurate and efficient simulation of wave propagation phenomena plays an important role in different engineering disciplines. In structural health monitoring, for example, ultrasonic guided waves are used to detect and localize damage and to assess the structural integrity of the component part under consideration. Because of the complexity of real structures, the numerical simulation of structural health monitoring systems is a computationally demanding task. Therefore, to facilitate the analysis of wave propagation phenomena, the authors propose to combine the finite cell method with the spectral element method. The ensuing novel method is referred to as the spectral cell method. Because it does not rely on body-fitted meshes, the resulting approach eliminates all discretization difficulties encountered in conventional finite element methods. Moreover, with the aid of mass lumping, it paves the way for the use of explicit time-integration algorithms. In the first part of the paper, we show that using a lumped mass matrix instead of the consistent one has no detrimental effect on the accuracy of the spectral element method. We introduce the spectral cell method in the second part, showing that, when applied to wave propagation analysis, the spectral cell method yields results comparable with other standard higher order finite element approaches.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{HadiHafezi2017,
abstract = {The interaction between surface wave and a surface breaking crack is studied using a novel fast modeling tool called peri-ultrasound that can model both linear and nonlinear ultrasonic response. This modeling approach is based on peridynamic theory. In this study, the surface wave is modeled by applying a triangular pulse excitation function on the surface of a large structure. The particle movements are simulated on both sides of the surface crack to investigate transmitted and reflected fields. This investigation shows that: (1) the computed amplitude spectra of the Rayleigh wave agrees with the experimental observation; and (2) the structure containing a surface breaking crack shows noticeable increase in its nonlinear behavior. The computed results have been also verified against the analytical solution for a half-plane problem made of homogenous, isotropic, linear elastic material (Lamb's Problem).},

@article{Duczek2015,
abstract = {This article introduces a robust and efficient numerical tool that is well suited for the simulation of ultrasonic guided waves and can be especially helpful when dealing with heterogeneous materials. The proposed method is based on a combination of high-order finite element methods (FEM) and the fictitious domain concept. If hierarchic shape functions, which are familiar from the p-version of the finite element method (p-FEM), are deployed the method is referred to as the finite cell method (FCM). Where Lagrange polynomials through Gau-Lobatto-Legendre points are used, we refer to it as the spectral cell method (SCM). The name, SCM, derives from the fact that the deployed shape functions are commonly utilized in the spectral element method. To model smart structure applications such as shape control problems, noise cancelation devices and the excitation/sensing of ultrasonic guided waves, a coupling between electrical and mechanical variables is also taken into account. In this context, we focus on including the linear theory of piezoelectricity in the variational formulation of the FCM and the SCM, respectively. Several numerical benchmark problems are then used to validate the proposed approach. The simulations show promising results with respect to the accuracy of the method and the computational effort. We observe similar convergence properties for the proposed high-order fictitious domain methods as with "conventional" high-order finite element approaches. Implementing the proposed method in existing finite element software is, moreover, a straightforward process. These properties make the method an efficient tool for practical applications in structural health monitoring problems and smart structure applications in general.},

@article{Frehner2008,
abstract = {Two-dimensional scattering of elastic waves in a medium containing a circular heterogeneity is investigated with an analytical solution and numerical wave propagation simulations. Different combinations of finite difference methods (FDM) and finite element methods (FEM) are used to numerically solve the elastodynamic wave equations. Finite difference and finite element techniques are applied to approximate both the time and space derivatives and are combined in various ways to provide different numerical algorithms for modeling elastic wave propagation. The results of the different numerical algorithms are compared for simulations of an incident plane P-wave that is scattered by a mechanically weak circular inclusion whereby the diameter of the inclusion is of the same order than the P-wave's wavelength. For this scattering problem an analytical solution is available and used as the reference solution in the comparison of the different numerical algorithms. Staircase-like spatial discretization of the inclusion's circular shape with the finite difference method using a rectangular grid provides accurate velocity and displacement fields close to the inclusion boundary only for very high spatial resolutions. Implicit time integration based on either finite differences or finite elements does not provide computational advantages compared to explicit schemes. The best numerical algorithm in terms of accuracy and computation time for the investigated scattering problem consists of a finite element method in space using an unstructured mesh combined with an explicit finite difference method in time. The computational advantages and disadvantages of the different numerical algorithms are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents an application of wavelet finite element method adopting B-spline wavelet on the interval to investigate static and free vibration problems of laminated composite plates. The energy of laminated composite plates is derived based on the higher-order plate theory, the wavelet-based BSWI element is constructed according to the principle of minimum total potential energy. WFEM employs two-dimensional BSWI scaling functions to replace polynomial interpolating functions used in traditional finite element method. Due to the excellent approximation properties of BSWI for structural analysis, WFEM could obtain accurate results with fewer degrees of freedoms. Numerical examples concerning the static and free vibration problems of symmetric and antisymmetric cross-ply/angle-ply laminated composite plates are displayed to elaborate the validity and high accuracy of the proposed wavelet-based method with three-dimensional elasticity and other referential results available in literatures. Meanwhile, the parametric effects of length-to-thickness ratios, layer numbers, fiber orientations and modular ratios on the deflections and frequencies are performed and discussed in details. In conclusion, WFEM has been proved to be an effective, accurate and stable numerical computation method for static and free vibration analysis of laminated composite plates.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel parallel implementation technology for wave-based structural health monitoring (SHM) in laminated composite plates. The wavelet-based B-spline wavelet on the interval (BSWI) element is constructed according to Hamilton's principle, and the element by element algorithm is parallelly executed on graphics processing unit (GPU) using compute unified device architecture (CUDA) to get the responses in full wave field accurately. By means of the Fourier spectral analysis method, the Mindlin plate theory is selected for wave modeling of laminated composite plates while the Kirchhoff plate theory predicts unreasonably phase and group velocities. Numerical examples involving wave propagation in laminated composite plates without and with crack are performed and discussed in detail. The parallel implementation on GPU is accelerated 146 times comparing with the same wave motion problem executed on central processing unit (CPU). The validity and accuracy of the proposed parallel implementation are also demonstrated by comparing with conventional finite element method (FEM) and the computation time has been reduced from hours to minutes. The damage size and location have been successfully determined according to wave propagation results based on delay-and-sum (DAS). The results show that the proposed parallel implementation of wavelet finite element method (WFEM) is very appropriate and efficient for wave-based SHM in laminated composite plates.},

@article{Samaratunga2014,
abstract = {This paper presents a new 2-D wavelet spectral finite element (WSFE) model for studying wave propagation in thin to moderately thick anisotropic composite laminates. The WSFE formulation is based on the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) which yields accurate results for wave motion at high frequencies. The wave equations are reduced to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using Daubechies compactly supported, orthonormal, scaling functions for approximations in time and one spatial dimension. The ODEs are decoupled through an eigenvalue analysis and then solved exactly to obtain the shape functions used in element formulation. The developed spectral element captures the exact inertial distribution, hence a single element is sufficient to model a laminate of any dimension in the absence of discontinuities. The 2-D WSFE model is highly efficient computationally and provides a direct relationship between system input and output in the frequency domain. Results for axial and transverse wave propagations in laminated composite plates of various configurations show excellent agreement with finite element simulations using Abaqus {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
