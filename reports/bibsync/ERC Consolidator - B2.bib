abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications call for both efficient and powerful numerical tools to predict the behavior of ultrasonic guided waves. When considering waves in thin-walled structures, so called Lamb waves, conventional linear or quadratic pure displacement finite elements soon reach their limits. The spatial as well as temporal discretisation, required to obtain good quality results has to be very fine. This results in enormous computational costs (computational time and memory storage requirements) when ultrasonic wave propagation problems are solved in the time domain. To resolve this issue several higher order finite element methods with polynomial degrees p{\textgreater}. 2 are proposed. The objective of the current article is to develop such higher order schemes and to verify their capabilities with respect to accuracy and numerical performance. To the best of the authors' knowledge such comparison has not been reported in literature, yet. Specifically, spectral elements based on Lagarange polynomials (SEM), p-elements using the normalized integrals of the Legendre polynomials (p-FEM) and isogeometric elements utilizing non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS, N-FEM) are discussed in this paper. By solving a two-dimensional benchmark problem, their advantages and drawbacks with respect to Lamb wave propagation are highlighted. The results of the convergence studies are then used to derive guidelines for estimating the optimal element size for a given finite element type and polynomial degree template. These findings serve the purpose to determine the optimal mesh configuration a priori and thus, save a considerable amount of computational effort. The proposed guideline is then tested on a three-dimensional structure with a conical hole showing an excellent agreement with the predicted behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The proposed spectral element method implementation is based on sparse matrix storage of local shape func-tion derivatives calculated at Gauss–Lobatto – Legendre points. The algorithm utilizes two basic operations: multiplication of sparse matrix by vector and element-by-element vectors multiplication. Compute-intensive operations are performed for a part of equation of motion derived at the degree of freedom level of 3D isopara-metric spectral elements. The assembly is performed at the force vector in such a way that atomic operations are minimized. This is achieved by a new mesh coloring technique The proposed parallel implementation of spectral element method on GPU is applied for the first time for Lamb wave simulations. It has been found that computation on multicore GPU is up to 14 times faster than on single CPU.},

Families of curves are obtained for aluminum and zirconium. The distinguishing characteristics of the various modes are discussed in the light of potential nondestructive testing applications.

abstract = {The solution to problems of elastic wave propagation in multilayered media, in which each layer is homogeneous and where the ensemble of layers has physical properties that vary on]y with one coordinate, may be given as the quotient of products of matrices. In the case of SH waves, the matrices are of order two; in the case of P-SV waves the matrices are of order four. The individual matrix elements are themselves determinants of order two or four in the two cases. The solution is obtained by means of Laplace's development by minors. The solution to problems of wave propagation in inhomogeneous media in which the inhomogeneity varies with only one coordinate is much simplified if we consider the problems of wave propagation in a medium consisting of a large number of homogeneous layers. The homogeneous layers are taken to approximate the in-homogeneous medium as closely as desired. The eigenfunctions in homogeneous media can be written much more simply than those for inhomogeneous media. In compensation for the gain in simplicity of the elementary solutions, one must now solve a large number of simultaneous equations with a correspondingly large number of unknowns. This problem, too, has been overcome with the applica-tion of large computational equipment, at least for specific models of the inhomo-geneities. The solution to the problems of wave propagation in such inhomogeneous media cart be expressed as the solution to a number of simultaneous equations, each ex-pressing the values of the appropriate elementary solutions at the boundaries be-tween adjacent layers. The solution to the simultaneous equations can be written in terms of a number of determinants constructed from the equations; it merely re-mains to evaluate the appropriate determinants. When the number of layers becomes large, the order of the determinantal equa-tions for the solution for plane harmonic waves becomes large. In the case of waves in a medium consisting of N layers overlying a half-space and underlying a void, the determinants are of order 2N -k 1 for scalar (SH) elastic waves and 4N -k 2 for vector (P and SV) elastic waves. These determinants become cumbersome even for moderate values of N. Hence some method of decomposition of the determinants is appropriate. Since the determinants are mostly diagonal, the decomposition is not difficult. The evaluation of the determinai{\~{}}ts can then be represented as a product of matrices. The advantages of using matrix representations in lengthy computer operations is evident since subroutines for matrix manipulation are in most computer libraries. One procedm'e for the matrix manipulation of elastic wave problems has been devised by Thomson (1950) and corrected and elaborated by Haskell (1953). In this paper, an alternative matrix procedure for determinautal decomposition and solu-tion is presented which is appropriate to machine computation. We consider first the case of scalar (SH) waves in a medium consisting of N fiat homogeneous layers overlying a half-space and underlying a void. We order the interfaces z0, z{\~{}}, • • • zN.

abstract = {The numerical instability problem in the standard transfer matrix method has been resolved by introducing the layer stiffness matrix and using an efficient recursive algorithm to calculate the global stiffness matrix for an arbitrary anisotropic layered structure. For general anisotropy the computational algorithm is formulated in matrix form. In the plane of symmetry of an orthotropic layer the layer stiffness matrix is represented analytically. It is shown that the elements of the stiffness matrix are as simple as those of the transfer matrix and only six of them are independent. Reflection and transmission coefficients for layered media bounded by liquid or solid semi-spaces are formulated as functions of the total stiffness matrix elements. It has been demonstrated that this algorithm is unconditionally stable and more efficient than the standard transfer matrix method. The stiffness matrix formulation is convenient in satisfying boundary conditions for different layered media cases and in obtaining modal solutions. Based on this method characteristic equations for Lamb and surface waves in multilayered orthotropic media have been obtained. Due to the stability of the stiffness matrix method, the solutions of the characteristic equations are numerically stable and efficient. Numerical examples are given. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

It is shownthat temporal and spatial focusing can be achieved through time reversal,although the dispersive behaviour of the flexural waves renders it impossible to exactly reconstruct the waveform of the original excitation. Based on the principle of the time-reversal concept, a digital imaging method suitable for distributed sensor/actuator networks has been developed. This new method, which overcomes the limitation of the conventional phased array method that operates under pulse-echo mode, provides an efficient imaging method for locating and approximate sizing of structural damages. In addition, it has been shown that signal strengths can be considerably enhanced by applying the present synthetic time-reversal method, thus reducing the number of sensors and actuators required to achieve a given signal-to-noise ratio.},

abstract = {Diffuse ultrasonic waves for structural health monitoring offer the advantages of simplicity of signal generation and reception, sensitivity to damage, and large area coverage; however, there are the serious disadvantages of no accepted methodology for analyzing the complex recorded signals and sensitivity to environmental changes such as temperature and surface conditions. Presented here is a methodology for applying diffuse ultrasonic waves to the problem of detecting structural damage in the presence of unmeasured temperature changes. This methodology is based upon the prediction and observation that the first order effect of a temperature change on a diffuse ultrasonic wave is a time dilation or compression. A multi-step procedure is implemented to (1) record a set of baseline waveforms from the undamaged specimen at temperatures spanning the expected operating range, (2) select a waveform from the baseline set whose temperature is the closest to that of a subsequently measured signal, (3) adjust this baseline waveform to best match the signal, and (4) calculate an error parameter between the signal and the adjusted waveform and compare this parameter to a threshold to determine the structural status. This procedure is applied to experimental data from aluminum plate specimens with artificial flaws. Probability of detection and the minimum flaw size detected are presented as a function of the size of the baseline waveform set. It is shown that a probability of detection of over 95{\%} can be achieved with a small number of baseline waveforms. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The rosettes are comprised of rectangular macro-fiber composite (MFC) transducers which exhibit a highly directive response to ultrasonic guided waves. The MFC response to flexural (A0) motion is decomposed into axial and transverse sensitivity factors, which allow extraction of the direction of an incoming wave using rosette principles. The wave source location in a plane is then simply determined by intersecting the wave directions detected by two rosettes. The rosette approach is applicable to anisotropic or geometrically complex structures where the conventional time-of-flight source location is challenging due to the direction-dependent wave velocity. The performance of the rosettes for source location is validated through pencil-lead breaks performed on an aluminum plate, an anisotropic CFRP laminate and a complex CFRP-honeycomb sandwich panel.},

abstract = {Permanently attached piezoelectric sensors arranged in a spatially distributed array are under consideration for structural health monitoring systems incorporating active ultrasonic methods. Most damage detection and localization methods that have been proposed are based upon comparing monitored signals to baselines recorded from the structure prior to initiation of damage. To be effective, this comparison process must take into account any conditions other than damage that have changed the ultrasonic signals. Proposed here is a two-step process whereby damage is first detected and is then localized and characterized. The detection strategy considers the long time behavior of the signals in the diffuse-like regime where distinct echoes can no longer be identified. The localization strategy is to generate images of damage based upon the early time regime when discrete echoes from boundary reflections and scattering sites are meaningful. Results are shown for an aluminum plate with artificial damage introduced in combination with temperature variations. The loss of local temporal coherence combined with an optimal baseline selection procedure is shown to be effective for the detection of damage, and a delay-and-sum imaging method applied to the residual signals both localizes the damage and provides characterization information.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) using guided waves is one of the only ways in which damage anywhere in a structure can be detected using a sparse array of permanently attached sensors. To distinguish damage from structural features, some form of comparison with damage-free reference data is essential, and here subtraction is considered. The detectability of damage is determined by the amplitude of residual signals from structural features remaining after the subtraction of reference data. These are non-zero due to changing environmental conditions such as temperature. In this paper, the amplitude of the residual signals is quantified for different guided-wave SHM strategies. Comparisons are made between two methods of reference signal subtraction and between two candidate sensor configurations. These studies allow estimates to be made of the number of sensors required per unit area to reliably detect a prescribed type of damage. It is shown that the number required is prohibitively high, even in the presence of modest temperature fluctuations, hence some form of temperature compensation is absolutely essential for guided-wave SHM systems to be viable. A potential solution is examined and shown to provide an improvement in signal suppression of approximately 30 dB, which corresponds to two orders of magnitude reduction in the number of sensors required.},

Some of the piezoceramics were used as actuators to dynamically excite specimens while others were used as sensors to measure the beam responses. Tests showed that a delamination changed the measured piezo-induced dynamic forced response of beams. A delamination identification method is proposed which consists of a structural analysis, a response comparator, and a damage selector. The structural analysis was developed for predicting the output voltages of the sensors when a delaminated beam was excited by the actuators.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016. To predict dispersion curves it is common to use different solution approaches depending on the material type, isotropic or composite, of the medium in which the wave propagates. The two different solution methods are defined in different domains, frequency–wavespeed domain for isotropic materials, and wavenumber–wavespeed domain for composites which can lead to difficulties, and unsatisfying results when predicting the dispersion curves for hybrid laminates which contain both isotropic and composite materials. This article, therefore, proposes a unified formulation defined in the wavenumber–wavespeed domain for both isotropic and composite materials. The unified formulation, simple, and mathematically straightforward formulation, utilizes Christoffel's equation for a lamina to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are then used to set up the field matrix from which the dispersion curves could be retrieved. Once the dispersion curves were obtained the waves are grouped using a modeshape analysis. A spline algorithm is applied to obtain a continuous solution from a rough domain which was used to reduce computational time. In addition, this article highlights the challenges faced in the numerical process, and provides a discussions of the methods used to overcome these obstacles.},

abstract = {This paper deals with a semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) method for modeling wave propagation in waveguides of arbitrary cross-section. The method simply requires the finite element discretization of the cross-section of the waveguide, and assumes harmonic motion along the wave propagation direction. The general SAFE technique is extended to account for viscoelastic material damping by allowing for complex stiffness matrices for the material. The dispersive solutions are obtained in terms of phase velocity, group velocity (for undamped media), energy velocity (for damped media), attenuation, and cross-sectional mode shapes. Knowledge of these properties is important in any structural health monitoring attempt that uses ultrasonic guided waves. The proposed SAFE formulation is applied to several examples, including anisotropic viscoelastic layered plates, composite-to-composite adhesive joints and railroad tracks. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Excellent agreement is obtained. It is shown that a 2-D Fourier transform method may be used to quantify Lamb wave interactions with defects. The sensitivity of individual Lamb waves to particular notches is dependent on the frequency-thickness product, the mode type and order, and the geometry of the notch. The sensitivity of the Lamb modes a(1), alpha(0), and s(0) to simulated defects in different frequency-thickness regions is predicted as a function of the defect depth to plate thickness ratio and the results indicate that Lamb waves may be used to find notches when the wavelength to notch depth ratio is on the order of 40.

Anomalies of propagating waves have enabled to develop damage detection algorithms. Depending on actuation-sensing strategies these algorithms can be classified as pitch-catch and pulse-echo. Despite many signal processing methods such as delay-sum, time-reversal, probability-based diagnostic imaging, etc. the spatial damage information provided by the actuator-sensor paths to reconstruct the damage image is limited. A novel strategy based on Lamb wave focusing is proposed in order to increase damage imaging resolution. In the proposed method all actuators are used at the same time exciting specially designed waveforms so that inspect one specific point of the structure. Damage map is created by applying appropriate signal processing. It uses dispersion curve of selected Lamb wave mode for dispersion compensation. The dispersion curve is acquired by using laser scanning Doppler vibrometer. The damage indicator is calculated based on the energy of compensated signals registered by sensors. It is shown that apart from high energy level at excitation point, energy is concentrated exactly in the damaged region. An example of crack detection and visualization in an aluminum plate is shown confirming the accuracy of the proposed method. Also the proposed method is compared to well-established delay-and-sum algorithm.},

The waves are generated by means of the wedge method using a narrowband source, selecting the wedge angle and the acoustic frequency f so that mainly one mode is excited. A self-developed pulsed electronic speckle pattern interferometry system renders a two dimensional map of the out-of-plane acoustic displacement field at the plate surface, which allows an accurate measurement of the acoustic wavelength lambda(1). For any mode, the relation between lambda(1) and f depends on the three unknown parameters, so at least three experimental measurements (lambda(1i),f(i)) with different frequencies and/or different modes are required to calculate them. The suitability of different Lamb modes to determine each parameter when the others are known is studied, as well as the conditions that the experimental set of values must fulfill to calculate all three parameters. Numerous Lamb modes at different frequencies are generated in each plate, and a fitting is made based on the minimization of the error function, resulting in an accuracy better than 1{\%}.},

abstract = {The propagation characteristics of Lamb waves in composites, with emphasis on group velocity and characteristic wave curves, are investigated theoretically and experimentally. In particular, the experimental study focuses on the existence of multiple higher-order Lamb wave modes that can be observed from piezoelectric sensors by the excitation of ultrasonic frequencies. Using three-dimensional (3-D) elasticity theory, the exact dispersion relations governed by transcendental equations are numerically solved for an infinite number of possible wave modes. For symmetric laminates, a robust method by imposing boundary conditions on the mid-plane and top surface is proposed to separate symmetric and anti-symmetric wave modes. A new semi-exact method is developed to calculate group velocities of Lamb waves in composites. Meanwhile, three characteristic wave curves: velocity, slowness, and wave curves are adopted to analyze the angular dependency of Lamb wave propagation. The dispersive and anisotropic behavior of Lamb waves in a two different types of symmetric laminates is studied in detail theoretically. In the experimental study, two surface-mounted piezoelectric actuators are excited either symmetric or anti-symmetric wave modes with narrowband signals, and a Gabor wavelet transform is used to extract group velocities from arrival times of Lamb wave received by a piezoelectric sensor. In comparison with the results from the theory and experiment, it is confirmed that multiple higher-order Lamb waves can be excited from piezoelectric actuators and the measured group velocities agree well with those from 3-D elasticity theory. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {When testing complex structures using a deployable guided wave system, the measured signals are often far too complex to directly interpret without a priori knowledge of the geometry of the structure. However, in a structural health monitoring (SHM) scenario, the sensors are permanently attached to the structure and so changes in the system can be monitored by comparison to an earlier baseline measurement, taken when the structure was undamaged. This paper investigates such a system for the SHM of plate-like structures using guided waves. The basis of the system is a distributed array of permanently attached piezoelectric guided wave transducers where pairs of transducers are used in pitch-catch configuration allowing the detection and localization of damage in the plate. It has been observed that the use of a single baseline measurement suffers in the medium to long-term due to the variation of environmental conditions. A key parameter in the instability is the change in the temperature of the test structure. A method of using a database of baselines, termed optimal baseline subtraction (OBS), is described and applied to an experimental SHM system. The objective of this paper is to investigate the suitability and robustness of OBS under varying rates of temperature change and its use in the localization of damage. Results have shown that through the OBS an improvement of up to 20 dB in signal-to-coherent noise ratio may be achieved compared with single baseline subtraction. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

The proposed methodology employs a network of transducers that are used to sequentially scan the structure before and after the presence of damage by transmitting and receiving Lamb wave pulses. A damage localization image is reconstructed by analyzing the cross-correlation of the scatter signal envelope with the excitation pulse envelope for each transducer pair. A potential damage area is then reconstructed by superimposing the image observed from each actuator and sensor signal path. Both numerical and experimental case studies are used to verify the proposed methodology for composite laminates. Three-dimensional finite element models with a transducer network consisting of four transducer elements are used in the numerical case studies. The experimental case studies employ a transducer network using four piezoelectric transducers as transmitter elements and a laser vibrometer to measure the response signals at four locations close to the transducers.

The arrays are placed in such a way that the angulardifference between them is 458 and the rotation point is the middle transducer, which is common for allthe arrays.

The whole array system is placed in the middle of the plate.Each linear phased array in the system acts independently and produces maps of a scanned fieldbased on the beam-forming procedure. These maps are made of time signals (transferred to spacedomain) that represent the difference between the damaged plate signals and those from the intactplate. An algorithm was developed to join all four maps. The final map is modified by proposed signal processing algorithm to indicate the damaged area of the plate more precisely.

abstract = {Typically, numerical simulations of Lamb wave propagation are done using material properties which originate from tensile testing. This approach is well established in relation to isotropic homogenous structures such as aluminium plates. However if this approach is used for woven composites such as carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP), inaccuracies can arise that stem from vastly different stress distributions, strain rates and amplitudes during Lamb wave propagation. In order to account for this, an approach is presented where the elastic properties in a numerical Lamb wave model are optimised to achieve good correlation between model predictions and experimental observations. Since the material properties are determined under a Lamb wave propagation regime, the strain rates and amplitudes are consistent with the intended modelling application. The approach is validated with an experimental case study involving a M18/G939 carbon-epoxy system. The methodology is shown to yield property estimates that furnish simulations that closely match observed behaviours. The optimised properties were significantly different to those supplied by the manufacturer, as much as 52{\%} for the in-plane stiffness. The findings demonstrate that large errors are possible if elastic properties determined using conventional quasi-static testing are used in Lamb wave simulations pertaining to woven composite materials.},

This algorithm has the computational efficiency and simplicity of the standard transfer matrix method and is unconditionally computationally stable for high frequency and layer thickness. In this algorithm, the stiffness (compliance) matrix is calculated for each layer and recursively applied to generate a stiffness (compliance) matrix for a layered system. Next, reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated for layered media bounded by liquid or solid semispaces. The results show that the method is stable for arbitrary number and thickness of layers and the computation time is proportional to the number of layers. It is shown both numerically and analytically that for a thick structure the solution approaches the solution for a semispace. This algorithm is easily adaptable to laminates with periodicity, such as multiangle lay-up composites. The repetition and symmetry of the unit cell are naturally incorporated in the recursive scheme. As an example the angle beam time domain pulse reflections from fluid-loaded multilayered composites have been computed and compared with experiment. Based on this method, characteristic equations for Lamb waves and Floquet waves in periodic media have also been determined.},

abstract = {This article presents an embedded signal processing subsystem constituting a part of a whole structural health monitoring system (SHM). Typical SHM system is responsible for elastic wave generation and sensing, signal acquisition, and signal processing. Signal processing subsystem was designed with the aim of localizing damage utilizing elastic wave propagation in the interrogated structure. The embedded signal processing subsystem is realized in a field programmable gate array chip, which also implements a damage localization algorithm designed for creating damage maps that can indicate elastic wave reflection sites within the investigated structure. Elastic waves are generated and received using a prototype electronic system developed specially for this purpose. Piezoelectric transducers are arranged in networks with different geometrical configurations (strip, cross, and square). Elastic waves are excited by a five-cycle tone burst signal with carrier frequency of 220 kHz. The investigated structure is a simple isotropic panel made out of aluminum alloy. First, dispersion curves are computed on the basis of registered elastic wave signals. These are subsequently used in the damage localization process. The damage localization process utilizes the base antisymmetric A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} mode. This article presents results of experimental verification of the developed damage localization algorithm as well as results of damage localization by the embedded subsystem. {\textcopyright} 2015 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.},

abstract = {For determination of mechanical parameters of CFRP we propose the use of a method based on the resonance of Lamb waves generated by Hertzian contact. In this paper are presented the theoretical base of the method, following the observation that in CFRP only A0 and S0 modes are propagated, observation obtained through experimental construction of dispersion curves of the phase velocity of the two fundamental modes. The comparison of the results obtained by classical tests and those obtained with the proposed method shows that, for the determination of in-plane properties (elastic modulus, shear modulus, Poisson coefficient), the resonance of Lamb waves generated by Hertzian contact is an available nondestructive method, having the advantages of not requiring coupling fluid (20) Determination of Elastic Properties of CFRP Using Lamb Waves Resonant Spectroscopy.

The goal of mimicking this capability in composites to create intelligent composite materials has led to the development of a bio-inspired stretchable network composed of numerous micro-fabricated sensors capable of detecting multiple stimuli. The components of the network are small scale and flexible making the network embeddable within complexly shaped composite layups and flexible structures with minimal impact on the host structure. This paper outlines recent progress in ongoing work to develop the bio-inspired network in order to create intelligent composite materials.},

@article{Yu2013a,
abstract = {Cracks are common defects in aluminum plate-like components that are in widespread use in aerospace, shipbuilding, and other industries. Ultrasonic detection using Lamb waves has proven to be an efficient method for crack detection and localization. However, quantitative information regarding crack size or orientation is of paramount importance for damage diagnosis and life prediction. In this article, employing a sparsely arranged piezoelectric sensor array, a quantitative crack detection and imaging approach using a Lamb wave-focusing array algorithm is developed and presented. Additionally, Lamb wave propagation on thin-wall plates and wave interaction with crack damage was studied using three-dimensional elastodynamic finite integration technique. The focusing array imaging algorithm was then developed and applied to both simulation and experimental data to generate intensity images of the structure under interrogation. Experimentally, wafer-type piezoelectric actuators/sensors are permanently installed on the testing structure to generate Lamb waves as well as to measure the waves propagating through the structures. Our results show that when applied to either experimental or simulated data, the focusing array algorithms yield images containing quantitative damage information. The results also demonstrate that three-dimensional elastodynamic finite integration technique can be used for future simulation-based investigations of sensing optimization for various damage scenarios. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

@article{Taupin2011,
abstract = {Guided waves (GW) are very attractive in nondestructive technique applications (eg. Structural Health Monitoring) because of their ability to propagate at long range. In a structure made of composite materials, their propagation is complex due to material anisotropy and to their dispersive and multi-modal nature. Interpreting measurements of GW in such a structure requires a sound grasp of their behaviour. Here, the Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) method is used for studying GW propagation in viscoelastic multilayered anisotropic plates. Beside classical post-processing techniques used to compute the displacement, dispersion and slowness curves, the Poynting vector is also obtained, allowing us to study energy propagation in complex plate structures. Then, GW propagation in multilayered viscoelastic composite (C-epoxy) plates is studied; different stacking sequences typical of those used to build aeronautical parts are considered. Phase, energy velocities and attenuation are studied for different propagation directions and frequencies. It appears that symmetries of GW behaviour are complex: the axes of symmetry depicting this behaviour do not coincide with those of stacking sequences and depend on frequency. Modes appearing above the first cut-off frequency have such a complex behaviour that they cannot be used in practical applications. {\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {A micromechanical model called MESOTEX is presented for prediction of the elastic behaviour of composites reinforced with non-hybrid weave (plain weave, satin weave and twill weave) and hybrid weave (hybrid plain weave and hybrid twill weave) fabrics. By using the classical thin laminate theory applied to each woven structure, this analytical model takes into account the strand undulations in the two directions and also integrates the geometrical and mechanical parameters of each constituent (resin, fill and warp strands). A representative volume is chosen for each woven composite and the fibre architecture is described by several functions. To determine the effectiveness of this analysis, the elastic properties predicted for each woven composite are compared with experimental results and results extracted from the literature. This correlation shows excellent agreement between measured and predicted values, with a very low calculation cost (CPU time of less than 0-01 s). {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This book will lead to fresh creative ideas for use in new inspection procedures. Although the mathematics is sometimes sophisticated, the book can also be read by managers without detailed understanding of the concepts as it can be read from a 'black box' point of view. Overall, the material presented on wave mechanics - in particular, guided wave mechanics - establishes a framework for the creative data collection and signal processing needed to solve many problems using ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation and structural health monitoring.
