abstract = {This paper presents a nonlinear elastic material model able to simulate the nonlinear effects generated by the interaction of acoustic/ultrasonic waves with damage precursors and micro-cracks in a variety of materials. Such a constitutive model is implemented in an in-house finite element code and exhibits a multiscale nature where the macroscopic behavior of damaged structures can be represented through a contribution of a number of mesoscopic elements, which are composed by a statistical collection of microscopic units. By means of the semi-analytical Landau formulation and Preisach-Mayergoyz space representation, this multiscale model allows the description of the structural response under continuous harmonic excitation of micro-damaged materials showing both anharmonic and dissipative hysteretic effects. In this manner, nonlinear effects observed experimentally, such as the generation of both even and odd harmonics, can be reproduced. In addition, by using Kelvin eigentensors and eigenelastic constants, the wave propagation problem in both isotropic and orthotropic solids was extended to the three-dimensional Cartesian space. The developed model has been verified for a number of different geometrical and material configurations. Particularly, the influence of a small region with classical and non-classical elasticity and the variations of the input amplitudes on the harmonics generation were analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {This article presents a parallel algorithm to model the nonlinear dynamic interactions between ultrasonic guided waves and fatigue cracks. The Local Interaction Simulation Approach (LISA) is further developed to capture the contact-impact clapping phenomena during the wave crack interactions based on the penalty method. Initial opening and closure distributions are considered to approximate the 3-D rough crack microscopic features. A Coulomb friction model is integrated to capture the stick-slip contact motions between the crack surfaces. The LISA procedure is parallelized via the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), which enables parallel computing on powerful graphic cards. The explicit contact formulation, the parallel algorithm, as well as the GPU-based implementation facilitate LISA's high computational efficiency over the conventional finite element method (FEM). This article starts with the theoretical formulation and numerical implementation of the proposed algorithm, followed by the solution behavior study and numerical verification against a commercial finite element code. Numerical case studies are conducted on Lamb wave interactions with fatigue cracks. Several nonlinear ultrasonic phenomena are addressed. The classical nonlinear higher harmonic and DC response are successfully captured. The nonlinear mode conversion at a through-thickness and a half-thickness fatigue crack is investigated. Threshold behaviors, induced by initial openings and closures of rough crack surfaces, are depicted by the proposed contact LISA model.},

@article{VanDenAbeele2004a,
abstract = {As a rule, problems of wave propagation in finite media with non-uniform spatial distribution of material properties can only be tackled by numerical models. In addition, the modeling of damage features in a material requires the introduction of locally non-linear and - more important - non-unique equations of state. Using a multiscale approach, we have implemented a non-linear hysteretic stress-strain relation based on the Preisach-Mayergoyz (PM) model, into a numerical elastodynamic finite integration technique program, which has originally been developed for linearly elastic wave propagation in inhomogeneous media. The simulation results show qualitatively good agreement with data of non-linear resonant bar experiments in homogeneously non-linear and hysteretic media. When the PM density distribution of hysteretic units at the mesoscopic level is not uniform and/or confined to a finite area in stress-stress space, the response at high amplitude excitation tend to deviate from the quasi-analytical results obtained in the case of a uniform PM-space density. Localized microdamage features in an intact medium can be modeled by conceiving finite zones with pronounced hysteretic stress-strain relations within a "linear" surrounding. Forward calculations reveal a significant influence of the amplitude dependent resonance behavior on the location (edge versus center of a bar), the extend (width of the zone) and the degree (density of hysteretic units) of damage. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Soleimanpour2017a,
abstract = {Detection and characterization of delamination damage are of great importance to the assurance of structural safety. This work investigates the potential of a baseline-free structural health monitoring technique based on higher harmonics resulting from the nonlinear interaction of guided wave and a delamination. The nonlinearity considered in this study arises from the clapping of the sub-laminates in the delaminated region, which generates contact acoustic nonlinearity. Both explicit finite element simulations and experimental tests are conducted on composite laminates containing a delamination of different sizes and at different through-thickness locations. The results show that the interaction between the fundamental asymmetric mode (A0) of guided wave and a delamination generates contact acoustic nonlinearity in the form of higher harmonics, which provides a good measure for identifying the existence of delaminations and determining their sizes in laminated composite beams. This new insight into the generation mechanisms of nonlinear higher order harmonics in composite laminates will enhance the detection and monitoring of damage in composite structures.},

@article{Vanaverbeke2007a,
abstract = {A multiscale model for the two-dimensional nonlinear wave propagation in a locally microdamaged medium is presented, and numerical simulations are analyzed in view of nondestructive testing applications. The multiscale model uses a statistical distribution of hysterons and upscales their microscopic stress-strain relations to a mesoscopic level. Macroscopic observations are then predicted by finite integration techniques. The influence of a small region with hysteretic nonlinearity on the generation of harmonics is investigated, and numerical results for different amplitudes of the input signal and different analysis techniques of the response signal are presented. Second, a study is conducted on the interaction of a Rayleigh wave with a microdamaged zone with hysteretic nonlinearity at the surface of an otherwise linear body, and the influence of the microdamaged zone on the surface wave velocity and on the generation of harmonics is examined. It is found that the effect of hysteresis on the Rayleigh wave propagation can be barely seen in the surface wave velocity measurement, but shows up nicely in the wave spectrum. The potential of a nonlinearity based depth profiling technique is explored by evaluating the nonlinear responses at different frequencies for a vertically stratified medium with spatially varying hysteresis properties.},

@article{Zumpano2007a,
abstract = {In order to reduce the costs related to corrosion damage in aircraft structures, it is vital to develop new robust, accurate and reliable damage detection methods. A possible answer to this problem is offered by newly developed nonlinear ultrasonic techniques, which monitors the nonlinear elastic wave propagation behaviour introduced by damage, to detect its presence and location. In this paper, a new nonlinear time reversal technique is presented for the detection and localization of a scattered zone (damage) in a multi-material medium. In particular, numerical findings on a friction stir-welded aluminium plate-like structure are reported. Damage was introduced in the heat affected zone and modelled using a multi-scale material constitutive model (Preisach-Mayergoyz space). Studies were conducted for two different transducer configurations. Particular attention was devoted to find the optimum time-reversed window to be re-emitted in the structures. The methodology was compared with traditional time-reversal acoustics (TRA), showing significant improvements. While the traditional TRA was not able to clearly localise the damage, the developed technique identified in a clear manner the faulted zone, showing its robustness to locate and characterize nonlinear sources, in presence of a multi-material medium. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Shkerdin2008a,
abstract = {The nonlinear interaction between a high frequency probing Lamb wave and a bilayer containing a tangential delamination at the interlayer interface, whose contact conditions are dynamically changing due to a high amplitude Lamb wave with a long wavelength, is modeled in a quasistationary approach. The impact of the evolution of the contact condition on the mode conversion coefficients that describe the interaction of the probing wave with the delamination region leads to spectral enrichment due to cross-modulation spectral components between the probing wave and the modulating wave. The dynamical behavior of the normal displacement at the externally accessible surfaces is investigated for two different types of incident probing wave, both for an absorbing and a nonabsorbing bilayer structure, for variations in the contact quality modulation and as a function of defect size. The results can serve as a parametric guide for experimentalists considering the use of nonlinear harmonic generation of Lamb waves as a tool for nondestructive testing of bilayers, such as rubber-steel composites, in storage tanks and pipelines. {\textcopyright} 2008 Acoustical Society of America.},

@article{Franz2012a,
abstract = {In the Preisach model a ferromagnetic structure is divided into magnetic domains, each switching between two different states. The hysteresis for a single domain is a rectangular-shaped hysteresis loop with an upper switching point $\alpha$ and a lower switching point $\beta$. The hysteresis of the whole ferromagnet is the superposition of all loops involved. The Preisach model comprises a weighting function $\mu$($\alpha$,$\beta$) for every pair ($\alpha$,$\beta$) that needs to be determined for every hysteresis curve from experimental data a priori. From a physicist's point of view the Preisach model could be employed for studying ensembles of ferromagnetic particles. The model can serve as a link between theory and experiment in order to describe a microscopical system by a macroscopical measurement. From an engineer's point of view a mathematical model for hysteresis could serve as a compact description of a ferromagnetic device in an electrical circuit. The case study presented here shows how the weighting function $\mu$($\alpha$,$\beta$) is determined for given values of ($\alpha$,$\beta$). The investigation is carried out within the development environment MATLAB. It is a standard that is available for many researchers in academia and industry and conveniently provides all necessary functionality. {\textcopyright} 2012 SIMULATION COUNCILS, INC.},
