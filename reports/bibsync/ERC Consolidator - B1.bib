abstract = {SUMMARY The proposed spectral element method implementation is based on sparse matrix storage of local shape func-tion derivatives calculated at Gauss–Lobatto – Legendre points. The algorithm utilizes two basic operations: multiplication of sparse matrix by vector and element-by-element vectors multiplication. Compute-intensive operations are performed for a part of equation of motion derived at the degree of freedom level of 3D isopara-metric spectral elements. The assembly is performed at the force vector in such a way that atomic operations are minimized. This is achieved by a new mesh coloring technique The proposed parallel implementation of spectral element method on GPU is applied for the first time for Lamb wave simulations. It has been found that computation on multicore GPU is up to 14 times faster than on single CPU.},

@article{Zeng2013,
abstract = {Dispersion is encountered very often in ultrasonic guided waves, and may decrease the performance for damage detection significantly. For this reason, many signal processing methods have been proposed to obtain each mode under serious dispersion. In this paper, a new scheme is established for waveform design to suppress the dispersion such that each wave packet can be separated clearly. In this method, the dispersion effect of the guided wave is pre-compensated for a particular distance as it propagates through the structure. The relationship between the resolvable resolution and the waveform parameters is discussed; this relationship is employed as a guide to separately identify the wave packets caused by different structural features. Subsequently, an experiment is carried out to compare the performance of the proposed method with the time-reversal method. By using the proposed method, closely distributed structural features can be recognized with ease in the time domain. {\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.},

@article{Wang2004b,
abstract = {This paper presents an experimental and theoretical investigation of the applicability of the time-reversal concept to guided waves in plate-like structures, where the stress waves are dispersive and of multi-modes. It is shownthat temporal and spatial focusing can be achieved through time reversal,although the dispersive behaviour of the flexural waves renders it impossible to exactly reconstruct the waveform of the original excitation. Based on the principle of the time-reversal concept, a digital imaging method suitable for distributed sensor/actuator networks has been developed. This new method, which overcomes the limitation of the conventional phased array method that operates under pulse-echo mode, provides an efficient imaging method for locating and approximate sizing of structural damages. In addition, it has been shown that signal strengths can be considerably enhanced by applying the present synthetic time-reversal method, thus reducing the number of sensors and actuators required to achieve a given signal-to-noise ratio.},

Piezoelectric wafer active sensors were used to generate and receive guided Lamb waves propagating in the plate-like structure. The development of a generic beamforming algorithm that does not require parallel ray assumption through using full wave propagation paths is described. A virtual beam steering method and device, the embedded ultrasonic structural radar, was implemented as a signal post-processing procedure. Several two-dimensional configurations were investigated and compared with beamforming simulation. Finally, rectangular shape arrays were developed for verifying the generic formulas and omnidirectionality. The rectangular arrays yield good directionality within the 360° full range and are able to detect damage anywhere in the entire plate. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Permanently attached piezoelectric sensors arranged in a spatially distributed array are under consideration for structural health monitoring systems incorporating active ultrasonic methods. Most damage detection and localization methods that have been proposed are based upon comparing monitored signals to baselines recorded from the structure prior to initiation of damage. To be effective, this comparison process must take into account any conditions other than damage that have changed the ultrasonic signals. Proposed here is a two-step process whereby damage is first detected and is then localized and characterized. The detection strategy considers the long time behavior of the signals in the diffuse-like regime where distinct echoes can no longer be identified. The localization strategy is to generate images of damage based upon the early time regime when discrete echoes from boundary reflections and scattering sites are meaningful. Results are shown for an aluminum plate with artificial damage introduced in combination with temperature variations. The loss of local temporal coherence combined with an optimal baseline selection procedure is shown to be effective for the detection of damage, and a delay-and-sum imaging method applied to the residual signals both localizes the damage and provides characterization information.},

@article{Huang2018,
abstract = {Lamb wave based damage detection techniques have been widely used in composite structures. In particular, these techniques usually rely on reference signals, which are significantly influenced by the operational and environmental conditions. To solve this issue, this paper presents a baseline-free damage inspection method based on the reciprocity principle. If a localized nonlinear scatterer exists along the wave path, the reciprocity breaks down. Through estimating the loss of reciprocity, the delamination could be detected. A reciprocity index (RI), which compares the discrepancy between the signal received in transducer B when emitting from transducer A and the signal received in A when the same source is located in B, is established to quantitatively analyze the reciprocity. Experimental results show that the RI value of a damaged path is much higher than that of a healthy path. In addition, the effects of the parameters of excitation signal (i.e., central frequency and bandwidth) and the position of delamination on the RI value are discussed. Furthermore, a RI based probabilistic imaging algorithm is proposed for detecting delamination damage of composite plates without reference signals. Finally, the effectiveness of this baseline-free damage detection method is validated by an experimental example.},

@article{Humar2006,
abstract = {Early detection of damage is of special concern for civil engineering structures. If not identified in time, damage may have serious consequences, both safety related and economic. The traditional methods of damage detection include visual inspection or instrumental evaluation. A comparatively recent development in the health monitoring of civil engineering structures is vibration-based damage detection. Vibration characteristics of a structure, that is, its frequencies, mode shapes, and damping are directly affected by the physical characteristics of the structure including its mass and stiffness. Damage reduces the stiffness of the structure and alters its vibration characteristics. Therefore, measurement and monitoring of vibration characteristics should theoretically permit the detection of both the location and severity of damage. However, in practice, a number of difficulties persist in vibration-based damage identification. As a result, most of the damage identification algorithms fail when applied to practical civil engineering structures. This article presents a survey of some of the more commonly used algorithms and describes the conditions under which they may or may not work. The success of individual algorithms is measured through computer simulation studies. It may, however, be noted that additional practical difficulties that cannot entirely be reproduced through computer simulation exist, which makes vibration-based damage identification a challenging field with many unanswered questions.},

abstract = {This paper presents the application of Lamb waves to inspect damage in composite laminates. The proposed methodology employs a network of transducers that are used to sequentially scan the structure before and after the presence of damage by transmitting and receiving Lamb wave pulses. A damage localization image is reconstructed by analyzing the cross-correlation of the scatter signal envelope with the excitation pulse envelope for each transducer pair. A potential damage area is then reconstructed by superimposing the image observed from each actuator and sensor signal path. Both numerical and experimental case studies are used to verify the proposed methodology for composite laminates. Three-dimensional finite element models with a transducer network consisting of four transducer elements are used in the numerical case studies. The experimental case studies employ a transducer network using four piezoelectric transducers as transmitter elements and a laser vibrometer to measure the response signals at four locations close to the transducers. The results show that the method enables the reliable detection of structural damage with locating inaccuracies of the order of a few millimeters inside as well as outside of an inspection area of 100 {\~{A}} 100mm2. {\^{A}} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Cracks are common defects in aluminum plate-like components that are in widespread use in aerospace, shipbuilding, and other industries. Ultrasonic detection using Lamb waves has proven to be an efficient method for crack detection and localization. However, quantitative information regarding crack size or orientation is of paramount importance for damage diagnosis and life prediction. In this article, employing a sparsely arranged piezoelectric sensor array, a quantitative crack detection and imaging approach using a Lamb wave-focusing array algorithm is developed and presented. Additionally, Lamb wave propagation on thin-wall plates and wave interaction with crack damage was studied using three-dimensional elastodynamic finite integration technique. The focusing array imaging algorithm was then developed and applied to both simulation and experimental data to generate intensity images of the structure under interrogation. Experimentally, wafer-type piezoelectric actuators/sensors are permanently installed on the testing structure to generate Lamb waves as well as to measure the waves propagating through the structures. Our results show that when applied to either experimental or simulated data, the focusing array algorithms yield images containing quantitative damage information. The results also demonstrate that three-dimensional elastodynamic finite integration technique can be used for future simulation-based investigations of sensing optimization for various damage scenarios. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},
