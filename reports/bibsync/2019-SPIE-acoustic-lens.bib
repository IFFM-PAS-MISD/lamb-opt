abstract = {Guided ultrasonic waves have shown great potential for structural health monitoring. Various types of transducer can be used for actuating and sensing of these waves. This includes non-contact approaches such as optical/laser techniques. Classical laser methods usually involve high energy interferometers. The paper demonstrates that a commercial laser vibrometer, designed for vibration/modal analysis, can be used for crack detection in metallic structures. The study involves a simple fatigue test in order to initiate and grow a crack. Lamb waves generated by one bonded piezoceramic transducer were sensed using a multi-point scanning laser vibrometer. The results demonstrate the potential of laser vibrometry for simple, rapid and robust detection of fatigue cracks in metallic structures. {\textcopyright} 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, guided wavefield interactions with delamination damage in laminated composite panels are investigated. The frequency-wavenumber representations of the guided wavefields show that different wavenumbers are present in the delaminated plate, compared to a pristine case. The wavenumbers are correlated to trapped waves in the delamination region. Novel approaches for imaging the composite panels using guided waves are discussed and demonstrated for quantitative evaluation of the delamination damage. A filter reconstruction imaging method is shown to provide a rapid technique to locate delamination damage by showing where guided wave energy is trapped. A spatial wavenumber-based imaging algorithm is applied to calculate wavenumber values at each spatial location and highlights the delamination damage as regions with larger wavenumber values. The imaging approaches are demonstrated using experimental data from a plate with a simulated delamination (teflon insert) and from a plate containing impact-induced delamination damage. The methods are also applied to a multiple mode guided wave case to demonstrate application to complex wave cases.},

abstract = {Piezoelectric materials that can function at high temperatures without failure are desired for structural health monitoring and/or nondestructive evaluation of the next generation turbines, more efficient jet engines, steam, and nuclear/electrical power plants. The operational temperature range of smart transducers is limited by the sensing capability of the piezoelectric material at elevated temperatures, increased conductivity and mechanical attenuation, variation of the piezoelectric properties with temperature. This article discusses properties relevant to sensor applications, including piezoelectric materials that are commercially available and those that are under development.

The study investigates simulated wing skin-to-spar joints with two different types of bond defects, namely poorly cured adhesive and disbonded interfaces. The bond-sensitive feature considered is the ultrasonic strength of transmission through the joints. The dispersive wave propagation problem is studied numerically by a semi-analytical finite element method that accounts for viscoelastic damping, and experimentally by ultrasonic testing that uses highly durable, flexible macro fiber composite transducers. The discrete wavelet transform is also employed to de-noise and compress the ultrasonic measurements.

abstract = {Ultrasonic guided wave modes are proposed to control the integrity of high-pressure composite tanks produced by EADS-ASTRIUM, France. The purpose is to demonstrate the potentiality of air-coupled transducers to set up a contact-less, single-sided technique for testing the moisture content and/or the micro-cracking of carbon-epoxy composite wound around a Titanium liner. Although guided waves have been experimentally propagated on a real tank, it was not allowed to damage this specimen. Therefore, plates made of similar composite materials than that constituting the tank winding were submitted to water intake or to thermal stresses. After immersing some plates in a humid chamber, it was demonstrated that the attenuation of the A0 guided wave mode is sensitive to the moisture content. Other plate samples were submitted to immersion in liquid nitrogen that induces transversal cracks shown to cause significant drops in the celerity of several guided waves. Inverse problems have been used for quantifying the effects of these damages on the material properties, and they showed that water intake increases the imaginary part of the Coulomb moduli, while micro-cracking decreases all the material stiffness moduli. Such changes in the material properties have then been used as input data for simulating waveforms corresponding to the propagation of circumferential or longitudinal wave modes in the tank. Changes in these waveforms, caused by simulated damages of the composite winding of the tank, have been shown to be quite significant. To conclude the study, an experimental sep-up using air-coupled transducers was employed to generate-detect guided wave modes over large distances in the real tank, with very good signal-to-noise ratios, thus demonstrating the possibility of using such elements for the non-destructive testing of high-pressure composite tanks during their lives. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Methodologies for non-destructive evaluation of mechanically induced fatigue in fibre reinforced polymers are discussed. Specimens made of non-crimp glass fabric are fatigued using three different load ratios (tension-tension, tension-compression, and compression-compression). The investigation involves two loading directions (0° and 90°) of the quasi-orthotropic composite. Based on mode conversion of air-coupled ultrasound to Lamb waves, variation in a0-mode velocity is measured in a non-contact and single-sided access configuration. The velocity measurements are performed within and outside the servo-hydraulic test rig used for inducing fatigue damage. Formation of cracks monitored in the transparent composite results in degradation of stiffness observed by the test rig. Decrease in a0-mode velocity caused by fatigue is shown to correlate closely with stiffness degradation for all loading ratios and directions. The correlation is studied by calculating a0-mode velocities from single-ply properties whose stiffness degradation was determined using the observed crack densities and a finite element based model. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

An air-coupled transducer (ACT) radiates acoustic pressure on the surface of the composite and generates Lamb waves within the structure. The out-of-plane velocity of the propagating wave is measured using a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). In this study, the non-contact automated system focuses on measuring A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} mode frequency-wavenumber, phase velocity dispersion curves using Snell's law and group velocity dispersion curves using Morlet wavelet transform (MWT) based on time-of-flight along different wave propagation directions. It is theoretically demonstrated that Snell's law represents a direct link between the phase velocity of the generated Lamb wave mode and the coincidence angle of the ACT. Using Snell's law and MWT, the former three dispersion curves of the A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} mode are easily and promptly generated from a set of measurements obtained from a rapid ACT angle scan experiment. In addition, the phase velocity and group velocity polar characteristic wave curves are also computed to analyze experimentally the angular dependency of Lamb wave propagation. In comparison with the results from the theory, it is confirmed that using the ACT/LDV system and implementing simple Snell's law method is highly sensitive and effective in characterizing the dispersion curves of Lamb waves in composite structures as well as its angular dependency.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s) 2017. This paper proposes a non-contact damage detection method based on Lamb waves generated by laser ablation (LA). Previously, Lamb waves generated by contact-type sensors such as acoustic emission or piezoelectric zirconate titanate devices have been studied to detect damage. Lamb wave generation systems with embedded contact-type excitation devices to objective structures to be inspected may quickly realize large-area damage detection on a huge object such as an aircraft. However, replacing contact-type devices with non-contact devices in Lamb wave generation systems, the systems will have sufficient potential to excite under the specific conditions such as submerged target structures in liquid and high-temperature substances. The LA-generated Lamb waves that have amplitudes several hundred times larger than those generated by conventional laser-thermoelastically generated Lamb waves are of advantage from the viewpoint of the signal-to-noise ratio in the measurements. When the laser fluence reaches 10 12 –10 14 W/m 2 , which is greater than that for laser-thermoelastic regime, a LA regime is induced. The amplitudes of the LA-generated Lamb waves might be higher than those of the laser-thermoelastically generated Lamb waves; this is within the scope of the assumption. Since the LA process entails a number of nonlinear processes such as melting, vaporization, and sublimation, it is important to confirm that LA could generate a Lamb wave and its mode. In this paper, Lamb waves that contain broadband frequency elements of more than several hundred kHz are generated by non-contact impulse excitation using LA, which is common in vibration tests in the high-frequency range, laser peening, propulsion of micro-aircraft, bolt loosening diagnosis, etc. The present method is evaluated by comparing the measured and calculated propagation phase and group velocities of the Lamb waves. Furthermore, the feasibility of our approach is demonstrated by non-contact damage detection against an aluminum alloy 2024 plate with a crack.},

This focusing effect improves the NDE (nondestructive evaluation) performance, which is dependent on the geometries of an arrayed arc slit. In this paper, the relationships between the parameters determining the slit geometry and the focusing effect of the generated Lamb wave was investigated using a parametric study, and appropriate values of the parameters were obtained to maximize the focusing ability.

abstract = {Piezoelectric transducers are widely utilized in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). They are used both in guided wave-based and electromechanical impedance-based methods. Transducer debonding or unevenly distributed glue underneath the transducer reduce the performance and reliability of the SHM system. Therefore, quality assessment methods for glue layer need to be developed. In this paper, the authors present results obtained from two methods that allow the quality assessment of adhesive bonds of piezoelectric transducers. The electromechanical impedance method is utilized to analyze transducer adhesive bonding. An improperly prepared bonding layer is a source for changes in the electromechanical impedance characteristics in comparison to a perfectly bonded transducer. In the resistance characteristics of the properly bonded transducer the resonance peaks of the structure were clearly visible. In the case when adhesive layer is not equally distributed under sensor, the amplitudes of structural resonance peaks are reduced. In the case of completely detached transducer, the structural resonance peaks disappear and only resonance peaks of the transducer itself are visible. These peaks (peaks of free transducer hanging on wires) are significantly larger than the resonance peaks of the investigated structure in the considered frequency interval. The bonding layer shape is also analyzed using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy in reflection mode. This method allows to visualize the adhesive layer distribution based on C-scan analysis. C-scans of signals or envelope-detected signals can be used to estimate the area of proper adhesion between bonding agent and transducer and hence provides a more quantitative approach towards transducer inspection.},

It consist of a primary spherical mirror with an output hole and a flat secondary mirror, normal to the propagation axis, that is the transducer surface itself. The device is modeled and acoustic field is calculated showing a collimated beam with a symmetrical focus. A prototype according to this design is built and tested with an ACU piezoelectric transducer with center frequency at 400 kHz, high-sensitivity, wideband and 25 mm diameter flat aperture. The acoustic field is measured and compared with calculations. The presented prototype exhibit a 1.5 mm focus width and a collimated beam up to 15 mm off the output hole. In addition, the performance of this novel design is compared, both theoretically and experimentally, with two techniques used before for electrostatic transducers: the Fresnel Zone Plate - FZP and the off-axis parabolic or spherical mirror. The proposed NC arrangement has a coaxial design, which eases the transducers positioning and use in many applications, and is less bulky than off-axis mirrors. Unlike in off-axis mirrors, it is now possible to use a spherical primary mirror with minimum aberrations. FZP provides a more compact solution and is easy to build, but presents some background noise due to interference of waves diffracted at out of focus regions. By contrast, off-axis parabolic mirrors provide a well defined focus and are free from background noise, although they are bulky and more difficult to build. Spherical mirrors are more easily built, but this yields a non symmetric beam and a poorly defined focus.},
